In April 1990, the Company was reincorporated in Delaware. Our corporate facilities and executive offices are located at 2100 Logic Drive, San Jose, California 95124, and our website address is </a><a href="http://www.xilinx.com/" target="_blank">www.xilinx.com.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Industry Overview</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are three principal types of ICs used in most digital electronic systems: processors, which generally are utilized for control and computing tasks; memory devices, which are used for storing program instructions and data; and logic devices, which generally are used to manage the interchange and manipulation of digital signals within a system. Xilinx designs and develops PLDs, a type of logic device. Alternatives to PLDs may include application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application specific standard products (ASSPs). PLDs, ASICs and ASSPs may be utilized in many of the same types of electronic systems. However, differences in unit pricing, development cost, product performance, reliability, power consumption, capacity, features and functionality, ease of use and time-to-market determine which devices are best-suited for specific applications.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">3</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_001.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PLDs have key competitive advantages over ASICs and ASSPs, including:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Faster time-to-market and increased design flexibility. Both of these advantages are enabled by Xilinx desktop software which allows users to implement and revise their designs quickly. In contrast, ASICs and ASSPs require significant development time and offer limited, if any, flexibility to make design changes.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">PLDs are standard components. This means that the same device can be sold to many different users for a myriad of applications. In sharp contrast, ASICs and ASSPs are customized for an individual user or a specific application.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PLDs are generally disadvantaged in terms of relative device size when compared to chips that are designed to perform a fixed function in a single or small set of applications. ASICs and ASSPs tend to be smaller than PLDs performing the same fixed function, resulting in a lower unit cost. However, there is a high fixed cost associated with ASIC and ASSP development that is not applicable to PLD customers. This fixed cost of ASIC and ASSP development is expected to significantly increase on next generation technology nodes. From a total cost of development perspective, ASICs and ASSPs have generally been more cost effective when used in high-volume production, and PLDs have generally been more cost effective when used in low- to mid-volume production. However, we expect PLDs to be able to address higher volume applications and gain market share from ASIC and ASSP suppliers as the fixed cost of ASIC and ASSP development increases on next generation technology nodes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An overview of typical PLD end market applications for our

0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our strategy for expansion is the displacement of ASICs and ASSPs in the development of next generation electronic systems. The costs and risks associated with application-specific devices can only be justified for high-volume or highly-specialized commodity products. Programmable platforms, alternatively, are becoming critical for our customers to meet increasingly stringent product requirements - cost, power, performance and density - in a business environment characterized by increased complexity, shrinking market windows, rapidly changing market demands, capped engineering budgets, escalating ASIC and ASSP fixed engineering costs and increased economic and development risk.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With every new generation of FPGAs, our strategy is to increase the performance, density and system-level functionality and integration, while driving down cost and power consumption at each manufacturing process node. This enables us to provide simpler, smarter programmable platforms and design methodologies allowing our customers to focus on innovation and differentiation of their products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our PLDs compete in the logic IC industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence and continuous price erosion. We expect continued competition from our primary PLD competitors such as Altera Corporation (Altera), Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (Lattice) and Microsemi Corporation (Microsemi), and from ASSP vendors such as Broadcom Corporation (Broadcom), Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. (Marvell) and Texas Instruments Incorporated (Texas Instruments), as well as from new companies that may enter the traditional programmable logic market segment. In addition, we expect continued competition from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the inception of FPGAs.

Distributors and independent sales representatives create demand within the balance of our customer base in defined territories. Distributors also provide inventory, value-added services and logistics for a wide range of our OEM customers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Whether Xilinx, the independent sales representative, or the distributor identifies the sales opportunity, a local distributor will process and fulfill the majority of all customer orders. In such situations, distributors are the sellers of the products and as such they bear all legal and financial risks generally related to the sale of commercial goods, including such risks as credit loss, inventory shrinkage, theft and foreign currency fluctuations, but excluding indemnity and warranty liability.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In accordance with our distribution agreements and industry practice, we have granted our authorized distributors the contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a periodic basis and also receive price adjustments for unsold product in the case of a change in list prices subsequent to the initial sale. Revenue recognition on shipments to distributors worldwide is deferred until the products are sold to the distributors’ end customers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Avnet, Inc. (Avnet) distributes the substantial majority of our products worldwide. As of March 28, 2015 and March 29, 2014, Avnet accounted for 67% and 55%, respectively, of our total net accounts receivable. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for 43%, 46% and 46% of our worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We also use other regional distributors throughout the world. We believe distributors provide a cost-effective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services. Since PLDs are standard products, they do not carry many of the inventory risks posed by ASICs, and they simplify the requirements for distributor technical support. From time to time, we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies, or move customers to a direct fulfillment model as we deem appropriate given our strategies, the level of distributor business activity and distributor performance and financial condition. See &quot;Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk&quot; to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. &quot;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,&quot; for information about concentrations of credit risk and &quot;Note 16.

(Samsung). Currently, UMC manufactures the majority of our wafers and TSMC manufactures the wafers for our newest products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Precise terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations with each wafer foundry.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our strategy is to focus our resources on market development and creating new ICs and software design tools rather than on wafer fabrication. We continuously evaluate opportunities to enhance foundry relationships and/or obtain additional capacity from our main suppliers as well as other suppliers of wafers manufactured with leading- edge process technologies, and we adjust loadings at particular foundries to meet our business needs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sort, Assembly and Test</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wafers are sorted by the foundry or independent sort subcontractors. Sorted die are assembled by subcontractors. During the assembly process, the wafers are separated into individual die, which are then assembled into various package types. Following assembly, the packaged units are generally tested by independent test subcontractors or by Xilinx personnel. We purchase most of our assembly and some of our test services from Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. in Taiwan and Amkor Technology, Inc. in Korea and the Philippines. We purchase most of our test services from King Yuan Electronics Company in Taiwan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Quality Certification</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Xilinx has achieved and currently maintains quality management systems certification to TL9000/ISO9001 for our facilities in San Jose, California; Longmont, Colorado; Singapore and Hyderabad, India. In addition, Xilinx achieved and currently maintains ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 environmental health and safety management system certifications in the San Jose and Singapore locations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Patents and Licenses</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While our various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. As of March 28, 2015, we held over 3,300 issued United States (U.S.) patents, which vary in duration, and over 300 pending U.S. patent applications relating to our proprietary technology. We maintain an active program of filing for additional patents in the areas of, but not limited to, circuits, software, IC architecture, IP cores, system design, testing methodologies and other technologies relating to our products and business. We have licensed some parties to certain portions of our patent portfolio and obtained licenses to certain third-party patents as well.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We have acquired various licenses from third parties to certain technologies that are implemented in IP cores or embedded in our PLDs, such as processors. Those licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell these PLDs to our customers. We also have acquired various licenses to certain third-party proprietary software, open-source software and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools. Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which customers depend.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We maintain the Xilinx trade name and trademarks, including the following trademarks that are registered in the U.S. and other countries: Xilinx, the Xilinx logo, Artix, ISE, Kintex, Spartan, Virtex, Vivado and Zynq. Maintaining these trademarks, and the goodwill associated with them, is important to our business.

We believe that failure to enforce our intellectual property rights or failure to protect our trade secrets effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We incurred, and in the future we may continue to incur, litigation expenses to defend against claims of infringement and to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties. However, any such litigation may or may not be successful.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 147pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">10</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_016.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Corporate Responsibility</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Xilinx places a high level of importance on corporate responsibility.

These targets address several parameters, including product design; chemical, energy, and water use; waste recycling; and emissions. As a company, we focus on reducing natural resource use, the solid and chemical waste of our operations and minimizing our overall environmental impact with regards to the communities around us and consistent with global climate change efforts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Community</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We are committed to growing strategic relationships with a wide range of local organizations and programs that are designed to develop and strengthen communities located around the world. Xilinx develops local community relationships at key sites through funding and involvement that encourages active participation, teamwork, and volunteerism. Xilinx supports opportunities initiated by its employees and that involve participation and empowerment of its employees.

RISK FACTORS</h1><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks to the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company’s management currently deems immaterial, also may impair its business operations. If any of the risks described below were to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and failure to do so would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our success depends in large part on our ability to develop and introduce new products that address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price, density, functionality, power consumption and performance. The success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors, including:</p></li><li style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">timely completion of new product designs;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">ability to generate new design opportunities and design wins;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">availability of specialized field application engineering resources supporting demand creation and customer adoption of new products;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies on circuit geometries of 28nm and smaller;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">achieving acceptable yields;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">ability to obtain adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">ability to obtain advanced packaging;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">availability of supporting software design tools;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">utilization of predefined IP logic;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">customer acceptance of advanced features in our new products; and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">market acceptance of our customers’ products.</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our product development efforts may not be successful, our new products may not achieve industry acceptance and we may not achieve the necessary volume of production that would lead to further per unit cost reductions. Revenues relating to our mature products are expected to decline in the future, which is normal for our product life cycles. As a result, we may be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from design wins for our newer products as well as anticipated cost reductions in the manufacture of our current products. We rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products, and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and other price/performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining consistent margins. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or to the extent that our products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 147pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">13</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_019.png"/></span></p></body></html>
