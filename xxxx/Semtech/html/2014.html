Business General</h1><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are a leading supplier of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products and were incorporated in Delaware in 1960. We design, develop and market a wide range of products for commercial applications, the majority of which are sold into the enterprise computing, communications, high-end consumer and industrial end-markets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Enterprise Computing<span class="p">: datacenters, passive optical networks, desktops, notebooks, servers, graphic boards, monitors, printers and other computer peripherals.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Communications<span class="p">: base stations, optical networks, carrier networks, switches and routers, cable modems, wireless LAN and other communication infrastructure equipment.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">High-End Consumer<span class="p">: handheld products, set-top boxes, digital televisions, tablet computers, digital video recorders and other consumer equipment.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Industrial<span class="p">: broadcast studio equipment, automated meter reading, military and aerospace, medical, security systems, automotive, industrial and home automation, video security and surveillance and other industrial equipment.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our end-customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers, including Alcatel-Lucent, Cisco Systems, Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., LG Electronics, Sharp Corporation, Nokia Solutions and Networks, Itron, Apple, Inc., Phonak International, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Google Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and ZTE Corporation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Overview of the Semiconductor Industry</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The semiconductor industry is broadly divided into analog and digital semiconductor products. Analog semiconductors condition and regulate “real world” functions such as temperature, speed, sound and electrical current. Digital semiconductors process binary information, such as that used by computers. Mixed-signal devices incorporate both analog and digital functions into a single chip and provide the ability for digital electronics to interface with the outside world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The market for analog and mixed-signal semiconductors differs from the market for digital semiconductors. The analog and mixed-signal industry is typically characterized by longer product life cycles than the digital industry. In addition, analog semiconductor manufacturers tend to have lower capital investment requirements for manufacturing because their facilities tend to be less dependent than digital producers on state-of-the-art production equipment to manufacture leading edge process technologies. The end-product markets for analog and mixed-signal semiconductors are more varied and more specialized than the relatively standardized digital semiconductor product markets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another difference between the analog and digital markets is the amount of available talented labor. The analog industry relies more heavily than the digital industry on design and applications talent to distinguish its products from one another. Digital expertise is extensively taught in universities due to its overall market size, while analog and mixed-signal expertise tends to be learned over time based on experience and hands-on training. Consequently, personnel with analog training are scarcer than digital trained engineers. This has historically made it more difficult for new suppliers to quickly develop products and gain significant market share.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Advancements in digital signal processing technology typically drive the need for corresponding advancements in analog and mixed-signal solutions. We believe that the diversity of our applications allows us to take advantage of areas of relative market strength and reduces our vulnerability to competitive pressure in any one area.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Business Strategy</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our objective is to be a leading supplier of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor devices to the fastest growing segments of our target markets. We intend to leverage our pool of skilled technical personnel to develop new products, or, where appropriate, use acquisitions to either accelerate our position in the fastest growing areas or to gain entry into these areas. In order to capitalize on our strengths in analog and mixed-signal processing design, development and marketing, we intend to pursue the following strategies:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leverage our rare analog design expertise</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have developed a strategy to invest heavily in human resources needed to define, design and market high-performance analog platform products. We have built a team of experienced engineers who combine industry expertise with advanced</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">4</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_001.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">semiconductor design expertise to meet customer requirements and enable our customers to get their products to market rapidly. We intend to leverage this strategy to achieve new levels of integration, power reduction and performance, enabling our customers to achieve differentiation in their end systems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Continue to release proprietary new products, achieve new design wins, and cross-sell products</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are focused on developing unique, new, proprietary products that bring value to our target customers in our target markets. These products typically are differentiated in performance but are priced competitively. We also focus on achieving design wins for our products with current and future customers. Design wins are indications by the customer that they intend to incorporate our products into their new designs. Although we believe that a design win is an indicator of future potential growth, it does not inevitably result in us being awarded business or receiving a purchase commitment. Our technical talent works closely with our customers in securing design wins, defining new products and in implementing and integrating our products into their systems. We also focus on selling our complete portfolio of products to our existing customers, as we believe the technical expertise of our marketing and sales team allows us to identify and capitalize on cross-selling opportunities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Focus on fast-growing market segments and regions</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We have chosen to target the analog segments of some of the fastest growing end-markets. We participate in these markets by focusing on specific product areas within the analog and mixed-signal market, including products for handheld equipment, high-end consumer equipment, communications infrastructure and certain broad-based industrial markets. All of these markets are characterized by their need for leading-edge, high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductor technologies.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The enterprise computing, communications, high-end consumer and industrial end-markets we supply are characterized by several trends that we believe drive demand for our products. The key trends that we believe are significant for our future growth include:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l1"><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Increasing bandwidth over high-speed networks, fueling growth in high speed voice, video and data transmission</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Increasing electronic system requirements for smaller, lighter, more highly integrated and feature rich devices</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Increasing need for more efficient energy management in the home and in industrial environments and the proliferation of ”green” standards</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our products address these market trends by providing solutions that are ultra-low power thus extending battery life, small form factor enabling smaller devices, highly integrated enabling more functionality within devices and high performance enabling product differentiation within our customer base. Additionally, as communications functions are increasingly integrated into a range of systems and devices, these products require analog sensing, processing and control capabilities, which increases the number and size of our end-markets. Finally, industrial, medical, high-end consumer and other end-market applications have increasingly incorporated data processing and communications features into their end systems resulting in more complex power and protection requirements, which in turn, has broadened the opportunities for selling our power and protection devices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We believe that certain emerging geographies, such as China, represent opportunities for added sales and end-customer diversity. Accordingly, we have bolstered our efforts in these regions to enhance our ability to expand our customer base.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leverage outsourced semiconductor fabrication capacity</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We outsource most of our manufacturing in order to focus more of our resources on defining, developing and marketing our products. Our primary outside wafer foundries are based in China, Israel, the United States, Europe and Taiwan. Our largest wafer source is a foundry based in China. We believe that outsourcing provides us numerous benefits, including capital efficiency, the flexibility to adopt and leverage emerging process technologies without significant investment risk and a more variable cost of goods, which provides us with greater operating flexibility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Products and Technology</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We design, develop, manufacture and market high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products. We operate and account for results in one reportable segment through four product lines: Signal Integrity and Timing, Protection, Power Management and High-Reliability and Wireless and Sensing. We have determined that one reportable segment most properly reflects our operations and internal decision making. Our product and service portfolio is used in one business (the analog and mixed-signal sector of the semiconductor industry), and it operates and competes in one business activity and economic environment. Our four product lines share customers, intellectual property, manufacturing resources, sales channels, marketing support and research processes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">5</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_002.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On March 20, 2012, we acquired, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Semtech Canada Inc., all outstanding equity interests of Gennum Corporation (“Gennum”) (TSX: GND), a leading supplier of high speed analog and mixed-signal semiconductors for the optical communications and video broadcast markets.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our primary reasons for the acquisition were to broaden our existing portfolio of high performance analog platforms and to acquire a portfolio of high-speed data communications and video platforms to create one of the industry’s most complete and robust high-speed analog and mixed signal portfolios. In addition, Gennum’s strong position in the emerging high-definition (&quot;HD&quot;) video surveillance market further diversifies our portfolio of high-performance analog semiconductors and provides cross-selling potential with the combined customer base. Since the time of the acquisition, we have reduced our level of investments in the 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps long-haul transport market as a result of increased competition from customers&#39; internally developed solutions and pricing pressure which resulted in our recognizing numerous charges, including impairment of goodwill, finite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 as discussed further in Item 7 of this report.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On March 7, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Cycleo SAS (“Cycleo”), a privately held company based in France that develops intellectual property (“IP”) for wireless long-range semiconductor products used in smart metering and other industrial and consumer markets. This transaction, which was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, complements our current wireless offerings and will bring customers a set of high-end, digitally enhanced wireless solutions.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our product lines include:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Signal Integrity and Timing Products<span class="p">. In December 2013 we combined our previous Advanced Communications and Gennum Product groups to create the Signal Integrity and Timing Product group. We design, develop and market a portfolio of optical communications, broadcast video, active cable transceiver and backplane products used in a wide variety of enterprise computing, industrial, communications and high-end consumer applications. Our broadcast video products offer advanced solutions for next generation video formats, ever increasing data rates and evolving I/O and distance requirements. Our security and surveillance products for high- definition closed circuit television (&quot;HDcctv&quot;) enable upgrade of analog closed circuit television (&quot;cctv&quot;) installations to full digital HD, leveraging the installed base of COAX cabling, and our fully integrated transmit and receive products enable the highest performance, longest reach HDcctv standards-compliant designs.

These ICs perform transmission functions used in high-speed networks at 40Gbps and 100Gbps. Our advanced communications products also feature a leading integrated timing sync solution for packet based communication networks and are used in a variety of communications and industrial applications.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Protection Products<span class="p">. We design, develop and market high performance protection devices, which are often referred to as transient voltage suppressors (“TVS”). TVS devices provide protection for electronic systems where voltage spikes (called transients), such as electrostatic discharge (&quot;ESD&quot;) or secondary lightning surge energy that can permanently damage sensitive complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (“CMOS”) ICs. Our portfolio includes filter and termination devices that are integrated with the TVS devices. Our protection products feature low capacitance, providing robust protection while preserving signal integrity in high-speed networking and video interfaces. These products also operate at very low voltage needed for today’s low voltage ICs. Our protection products can be found in a broad range of applications including smart phones, LCD TVs, set-top boxes, tablet computers, notebooks, base stations, routers, and industrial instruments.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Power Management and High-Reliability Products<span class="p">. Power management products control, alter, regulate and condition the power supplies within electronic systems. The highest volume product types within the power management product line are switching voltage regulators, combination switching and linear regulators, smart regulators and charge pumps. Our power management products feature highly integrated devices for the telecom industry and low-power, small form factor and high-efficiency products for mobile phones, notebook computers, computer peripherals and other portable devices. The primary application for these products is power regulation for computer, communications, high-end consumer and industrial systems.

style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Historically, our results have reflected some seasonality, with demand levels generally being slightly lower in the computer and high-end consumer products segments during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year in comparison to the second and third quarters.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align:

0pt;text-align: left;">The development of intellectual property (“IP”) and the resulting proprietary products is a critical success factor for us. Recruiting and retaining key technical talent is the foundation for designing, developing and selling this IP, in the form of new proprietary products, in the global marketplace. One of our strategies to recruit this talent is the establishment of multiple design center locations. As a result, we have design centers throughout the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Circuit design engineers, layout engineers, product and test engineers, application engineers and field application engineers are our most valuable employees. Together they perform the critical tasks of design and layout of integrated circuits, turning these circuits into silicon devices, and conferring with customers about designing these devices into their applications. The majority of our engineers fit into one of these categories. Most of these engineers have many years of experience in the design, development and layout of circuits targeted for use in protection, advanced communications, power management and high-reliability, multimedia and data communications, and wireless and sensing applications. We also employ a number of software engineers and systems engineers that specialize in the development of software and systems architecture, who enable us to develop systems oriented products in select markets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In fiscal year 2014, we incurred $137.4 million of product development and engineering expense. This represents 23% of net sales. These expenses included $7.7 million of impairment charges relating to the reorganization of the Advanced Communications reporting unit, prior to the integration with the Gennum reporting unit, which resulted from the Company&#39;s decision to reduce investments in the optical long-haul market. Product development and engineering costs were $120.0 million or 21% of net sales and $80.6 million or 17% of net sales in fiscal years2013 and 2012, respectively. We intend to make further</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">8</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_016.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">investments in research and development in the future, which may include increasing our employee headcount and investing in design and development equipment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We occasionally enter into agreements with customers that allow us to recover certain costs associated with product design and engineering services. Any recovery for these services is recognized during the period in which services are performed, which historically lags behind the period in which we recognize expense. This difference in recognition timing can create volatility in our reported development and engineering expenses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales and Marketing</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales made directly to customers during fiscal year2014 were approximately 57% of net sales. The remaining 43% of net sales were made through independent distributors. We have direct sales personnel located throughout the United States, Europe and Asia who manage the sales activities of independent sales representative firms and independent distributors. We expense our advertising costs as they are incurred.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We operate internationally through our wholly owned Swiss and Canadian subsidiaries, Semtech International AG and Semtech Canada Corporation. Semtech International AG serves the European markets from its headquarters in Wil, Switzerland and through its wholly owned subsidiaries based in France, Germany, Neuchatel – Switzerland, the United Kingdom, China and Malaysia. Semtech International AG maintains branch offices, either directly or through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, in Taiwan, Korea and Japan. Semtech International AG also maintains representative offices in China. Semtech Canada Corporation serves the North American market for Gennum products, which are now part of the Signal Integrity and Timing group, from its headquarters in Burlington, Ontario. Semtech Canada Corporation also serves the European and Japanese markets through its wholly owned subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Japan. Independent representatives and distributors are also used to serve customers throughout the world.

approximately $84.4 million, $113.8 million and $75.6 million, respectively. The majority of our backlog is typically requested for delivery within six months. In markets where the end system life cycles are relatively short, customers typically request delivery in four to eight weeks. A backlog analysis at any given time gives little indication of our future business except on a short-term basis, principally within the next 45 days. We do not have any significant contracts with our customers calling for shipments over a period of more than 18 months.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing Capabilities</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our strategy is to outsource the majority of our manufacturing functions to third-party foundries and assembly and test contractors. The third-party foundries fabricate silicon wafers and the assembly and test contractors package and test our products. We believe this outsourcing permits us to take advantage of the best available technology, leverage the capital investment of others, and reduce our operating costs associated with manufacturing assets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">10</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_032.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We perform a limited amount of internal probe and final test activities at our facilities in Camarillo, Irvine, Redondo Beach and San Diego, California; Neuchatel, Switzerland; and Reynosa, Mexico. These activities accommodate situations in which tight coupling with product design is desirable or where there are unique requirements. Our packaged discrete rectifier products are packaged and tested in-house in Reynosa, Mexico. Almost all of our other products are packaged and tested by outside subcontractors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In keeping with our mostly “fabless” business model, we have no wafer fabrication facilities except for our operation in Reynosa, Mexico. For fiscal year2014, the Reynosa facility provided almost all of the silicon for our packaged discrete rectifier products, which were approximately 3% of our end product sales. The remaining 97% of our end products were supported with finished silicon wafers purchased from outside wafer foundries in China, Taiwan, Germany, Israel and France.We anticipate that more than 90% of all silicon wafers we require will come from outside foundries in fiscal year 2015.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Despite our use of outside wafer foundries for sourcing a majority of our silicon needs, we do maintain internal process development capabilities. Our process engineers work closely with our outside foundries on the improvement and development of process capabilities. In fiscal year 2014, we purchased the vast majority of our wafers from approximately six different third-party wafer foundries and used various manufacturing processes, including Bipolar, High-Speed Bipolar, Complementary Metal- Oxide-Semiconductor (“CMOS”), RF-CMOS, Bi-CMOS and Silicon Germanium (&quot;SiGe&quot;) processes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">While we do have some redundancy of fabrication processes by using multiple outside foundries, any interruption of supply by one or more of these foundries could materially impact us. As a result, we maintain some amount of business interruption insurance to help reduce the financial risk associated with a wafer supply interruption, but we are not fully insured against this risk.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although our products are made from basic materials (principally silicon, metals and plastics), all of which are available from a number of suppliers, capacity at wafer foundries sometimes becomes constrained. The limited availability of certain materials, such as silicon wafer substrates, may impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand needs or impact the price we are charged. The prices of certain other basic materials, such as metals, gases and chemicals used in the production of circuits have all increased in recent years as demand has grown for these basic commodities. In most cases we do not procure these materials ourselves, but we are nevertheless reliant on these materials for producing our products because our outside foundry and package and test subcontractors must procure them. To help minimize risks associated with constrained capacity, we use multiple foundries and have taken other steps to prevent supply interruptions at certain foundries and subcontractors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our largest wafer source is a foundry in China. In fiscal year2014, this Chinese foundry provided 38% of our total silicon requirements in terms of cost of wafers purchased. We have consigned certain equipment to this foundry to support our specialized processes run at the foundry and to ensure a specified level of capacity over the next few years. While the provision of these assets to the wafer foundry may be factored into certain pricing arrangements with the foundry, the impact of any pricing adjustments is insignificant and does not impact our margin trends.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most of our ultra-high speed 40Gbps and 100Gbps SerDes products are dependent on a single fabrication facility, located within the United States, for wafers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We use third-party subcontractors to perform almost all of our assembly and test operations. A majority of our assembly and test activity is conducted by third-party subcontractors based in China, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Korea and the Philippines. We have operations offices located in the Philippines, Malaysia and China that support and coordinate some of the worldwide shipment of products. We have installed our own test equipment at some of our packaging and testing subcontractors in order to ensure a certain level of capacity, assuming the subcontractor has ample employees to operate the equipment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our arrangements with both outside wafer foundries and package and test subcontractors are designed to provide some assurance of capacity but are not expected to assure access to all the manufacturing capacity we may need in the future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures to continue. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit key engineering talent, our ability to execute on new product developments and our ability to persuade customers to design these new products into their applications. Our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product as the volumes typically increase. However, price decreases can sometimes be quite rapid and faster than the rate of increase of the associated product volumes. We believe we compete effectively based upon our ability to capitalize on efficiencies and economies of scale in production and sales, and our ability to maintain or improve our productivity and product yields to reduce manufacturing costs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">11</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_033.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are in direct and active competition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with numerous manufacturers of varying size, technical capability and financial strength. A number of these competitors are dependent on semiconductor products as their principal source of income, and some are much larger than we are. The number of competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate. We consider our primary competitors with respect to our Protection Products to include STMicroelectronics, NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation and Infineon Technologies AG. Our primary competitors with respect to our Signal Integrity and Timing products are Texas Instruments Incorporated, Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., M/A-COM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., Inphi Corporation, Broadcom Corporation, Applied Micro Circuits Corporation and our customer’s own internal solutions. With respect to our Power Management and High Reliability products, we consider our primary competitors to include Texas Instruments Incorporated, Linear Technology Corporation, Maxim Integrated Products Inc., Microsemi Corporation and Monolithic Power Systems. Our primary competitors with respect to our Wireless and Sensing products include Silicon Laboratories, Texas Instruments Incorporated, Atmel Corporation, Analog Devices Inc. and Cypress Semiconductor Corp.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intellectual Property and Licenses</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have been granted 154 U.S. patents and 48 foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending with respect to our products and to technologies associated with our business. The expiration dates of issued patents range from 2014 to 2031. Although we consider patents to be helpful in maintaining a competitive advantage, we do not believe they create definitive competitive barriers to entry. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will lead to issued patents, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies, or that our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by others. We have no revenue from patents that expire in 2014 and no significant revenue associated with patents that expire in 2015 or 2016.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have registered many of our trademarks in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. Registration generally provides rights in addition to basic trademark protections and is typically renewable upon proof of continued use. We have registered, or are in the process of registering, our SEMTECH trademark in many jurisdictions. In one location use of this trademark is prohibited, but we are permitted to use our Semtech International trade name. This restriction has not had a material impact on our business to date and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in the future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We also have registered certain materials in which we have copyright ownership, which provides additional protection for this intellectual property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of January 26, 2014, we had 1,455 full-time employees. There were 526 employees in research and development, 240 in sales, marketing and field services, and 291 in general, administrative and finance. The remaining employees support operational activities, including product and test engineering, assembly, manufacturing, distribution and quality functions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have not had a work stoppage in at least the last decade and the only unionized employees are approximately 192 Mexican nationals who work at our manufacturing facility in Reynosa, Mexico. Our employee relations during the last fiscal year have been, and remain, satisfactory.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We adjust our workforce from time to time to meet the changing needs of our business. Competition for key design engineering talent globally is significant.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Government Regulations and Environmental Matters</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with numerous government regulations that are normal and customary to businesses in our industry and that operate in our markets and operating locations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our sales that serve the military and aerospace markets primarily consist of our Microwave and High-Reliability products that have been qualified to be sold in these markets by the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”). In order to maintain these qualifications, we must comply with certain specifications promulgated by the DOD. As part of maintaining these qualifications, we are routinely audited by the DOD. Based on current specifications, we believe we can maintain our qualifications for the foreseeable future. However, these specifications could be modified by the DOD in the future or we could become subject to other government requirements, which could make the manufacturing of these products more difficult and thus could adversely impact our profitability in the Power Management and High Reliability and Signal Integrity and Timing product lines. In fiscal year 2014, our sales that serve military and aerospace markets made up 5% of net sales. The U.S. State Department has determined that a small number of special assemblies from the Power Management and High Reliability and Signal Integrity and Timing product lines are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”). We have a Technical Assistance Agreement in place that permits us to assemble certain of these products in Mexico. Other products</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">12</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_034.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">subject to ITAR regulations are manufactured in our Redondo Beach, CA facilities. International shipments of these products require a State Department license.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our facilities throughout the world are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with those laws and regulations. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, liabilities under various statutes for the cleanup of pollutants at locations we have operated and at third- party disposal and recycling sites we have used. During fiscal years 2014 and 2012, the expense incurred with respect to these clean up matters was not material. In fiscal year 2013, we recorded a $2.5 million environmental reserve associated with the November 2012 draft clean up and abatement order discussed below. New laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations could subject our ongoing operations to different or additional environmental standards that could increase our cost of compliance in the future. In addition, our cost of doing business could increase if our suppliers increase prices to recoup the cost of their compliance with environmental laws or regulations. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have used an environmental firm, specializing in hydrogeology, to perform monitoring of the groundwater at our former facility in Newbury Park, California that was leased for approximately forty years. We vacated the building in May 2002. Certain contaminants have been found in the local groundwater and site soils.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Groundwater monitoring results to date over a number of years suggest that a measurable amount of groundwater contaminants of concern are believed to come from, or be contributed by, in full or in material part, adjacent facilities and/or to come from environmental cleanup operations separately conducted on the adjacent facilities, never owned or occupied by us. Responsibility for soil contamination remains under investigation. The location of key soil contamination (and some related site groundwater impact associated with the soil contamination) is concentrated in and found to emanate from an area of an underground storage tank that we believe to have been installed and primarily used in the early 1960s by a former tenant at the site who preceded our tenancy. The applicable regulatory agency having authority over the site issued joint instructions in November 2008, ordering us and the current owner of the site to perform additional assessments and surveys, and to create ongoing groundwater monitoring plans before any final regulatory action for “no further action” may be approved. In September 2009, the regulatory agency issued supplemental instructions to us and the current site owner regarding previously ordered site assessments, surveys and groundwater monitoring. In November 2012, the regulatory agency listed two more potentially responsible parties to the matter, based on historical evidence of past occupancy or operations at the site dating to the 1960s. In addition, the regulatory agency’s November 2012 action included a draft cleanup and abatement order to all the parties. Responses to the draft orders were submitted in a timely manner by all the parties in January 2013. In October 2013, the regulatory agency issued a final cleanup and abatement order. The October 2013 order removed the two additional potentially responsible parties from further participation or liability under the order. The October 2013 order was consistent and duplicative of the November 2012 draft order in all other material respects, including the scope of proposed additional site work, monitoring, and proposed remediation activities. We have filed an appeal of the October 2013 order seeking reconsideration of the removal of the two other potentially responsible parties, and seeking clarification of certain other factual findings by the regulatory agency. Other parties have filed their own responses to the October 2013 order. Further action and response from the regulatory agency is pending. The parties are expected to work cooperatively in responding to and determining the appropriate scope and extent of additional site investigative and categorization work, as well as in relation to any ultimate clean up and abatement work.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have accrued liabilities where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Based upon, and in anticipation of the likely outcome associated with the November 2012 draft cleanup and abatement order and the October 2013 final cleanup and abatement order, we engaged an environmental firm to assist in an assessment of this site consistent with the direction and scope of the cleanup and abatement order. Based on our preliminary assessment following the November 2012 draft cleanup and abatement order, which has been reviewed now again under the October 2013 final cleanup and abatement order pending the current appeal by us and other impacted parties, we have determined a likely range of probable loss between $2.5 million and $5.7 million. Given the as yet unresolved status of the cleanup and abatement order and uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and the remediation activities, we are unable to determine a best estimate within the range of loss. Therefore, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, we recorded the minimum amount of $2.5 million under “Accrued liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets, and under “Selling, general and administrative” in the consolidated statements of operations. These estimates could change as a result of changes in planned remedial actions, further actions from the regulatory agency, remediation technology, and other factors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Available Information</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.semtech.com/" class="s11" target="_blank">General information about us can be found on our website at</a><a href="http://www.semtech.com/" class="a" target="_blank">www.semtech.com</a>.

The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may cause us to experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in our results of operations. The growth rate of the global economy is one of the factors affecting demand for semiconductor components. Many factors could adversely affect regional or global economic growth including increased price inflation for goods, services or materials, rising interest rates in the United States and the rest of the world, or tight credit markets. In addition, economic slowdowns may also affect our customers’ ability to pay for our products. Accordingly, economic slowdowns may harm our business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current global economic conditions could reduce demand for our products.</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Uncertainty about global economic conditions can pose a risk to the overall economy by causing fluctuations to and reductions in consumer and commercial spending. Demand for our products could be different from our expectations due to many factors including changes in business and economic conditions, conditions in the credit market that affect consumer confidence, customer acceptance of our products, changes in customer order patterns, including order cancellations, and changes in the level of inventory held by vendors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Business interruptions could harm our business.</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our corporate headquarters, a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines. We do not maintain earthquake insurance and our business could be harmed in the event of a major earthquake. We generally do not maintain flood coverage, including for our Asian locations where certain of our operations support and sales offices are located. Such flood coverage has become very expensive; as a result we have elected not to purchase this coverage. If one of these locations were to experience a major flood, our business may be harmed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our business could be harmed if natural disasters interfere with production of wafers by our suppliers, with assembly and testing of products by our subcontractors, or with our distribution network. We maintain some business interruption insurance to help reduce the effect of such business interruptions, but we are not fully insured against such risks. Likewise, our business could be adversely impacted if a natural disaster were to shut down or significantly curtail production by one or more of our end customers. Any such loss of revenue due to a slowdown or cessation of end customer demand is uninsured.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When natural disasters such as an earthquake or other causes result in wide-spread destruction, the impact on our business may not be readily apparent. This is especially true when trying to assess the impact of the disaster on our end customers, who themselves may not fully understand the impact of the event on their businesses. The full extent and scope of natural disaster impacts, both in terms of direct impact on us and our supply chain, as well as on our end customers (to include their own supply chain issues as well as end-market issues), may not be known for a considerable period of time following the disaster. When any such natural disaster occurs, there can be no assurance that our results of operations may not be materially affected as a result of the impact of the disaster on us or on our end customers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We rely on third party freight firms for nearly all of our shipments from vendors to assembly and test sites, primarily in Asia, and for shipments of our final product to customers. This includes ground and air transportation. Any significant disruption of such freight business globally or in certain parts of the world, particularly where our operations are concentrated, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. Business interruption insurance may not provide enough protection to compensate us for losses that may occur. Accordingly, any of these disruptions could significantly harm our business.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Terrorist attacks, wars and other acts of violence, such as those that may result from the tension in the Middle East and the Korean peninsula, or any other national or international crisis, calamity or emergency, may result in interruption to the business activities of many entities, business losses and overall disruption of the economy at many levels. These events may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our customers and suppliers. Additionally, these events or armed conflicts may cause some of our customers or potential customers to reduce the level of expenditures on their services and products that ultimately may reduce our revenue. The consequences of these reductions are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, as a result of these events, insurance premiums for businesses may increase and the scope of coverage may be decreased. Consequently, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for our business and properties. To the extent that these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, a general decrease in corporate spending, or our inability to effectively market our services and products, our business and results of operations could be harmed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">15</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_037.png"/></span></p></body></html>
