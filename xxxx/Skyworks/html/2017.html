The joint venture was dissolved and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. With the overall demand for SAW and TC-SAW filters increasing and as technology and product architectures become more complex and the number of required bands grows, this investment assists us in securing a consistent supply of SAW and TC-SAW filters, in addition to allowing us to integrate filters into the design and production of our own products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">INDUSTRY BACKGROUND</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wireless connectivity is exploding, fueled by a powerful underlying demand to connect everyone and everything all the time. With wireless platforms serving as virtual hubs for e-commerce, enterprise to the cloud, social media, gaming and entertainment, these devices are enabling a new, multi-trillion dollar economy as the traditional brick-and-mortar model gives way to mobile-centric business models. Popular apps including Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Spotify, Uber, Waze and YouTube all require ultra-fast, highly secure, low-latency and always-on connectivity as well as GPS location-based services. As a result, semiconductor solutions are becoming increasingly relevant, particularly as they resolve the daunting analog and RF complexities that are challenging the capabilities of existing hardware and the supporting network infrastructure. Semiconductor devices continue becoming smaller, more powerful, and easier to integrate across multiple communication protocols, which in turn is enabling mobile and IoT ecosystems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Within mobile, Skyworks facilitates ubiquitous data creation, delivery and storage as smartphones transmit and receive immense amounts of content supporting multimedia streaming, social networking, gaming and emerging virtual reality. To enable these applications, we deliver highly integrated solutions leveraging our amplification, filtering, tuning, power management and packaging capabilities to continuously push the performance envelope.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Demand for connectivity across emerging markets around the world also continues to grow as the industry drives toward connecting the billions of people who remain unconnected. According to The GSMA Foundation, there will be 5.7 billion mobile subscribers by 2020, representing almost three-quarters of the world’s population. Subscriber growth over this period is forecast to be driven primarily by large markets in Asia, such as India, which alone is expected to add 310 million new unique subscribers by 2020.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">At the same time, connectivity is proliferating into an adjacent set of IoT markets. From smart homes to the smart grid and from industrial to wearables, the number of connected devices is increasing exponentially. In fact, IHS Markit Ltd. projects the IoT market to grow from an installed base of 15 billion units in 2015 to more than 75 billion units by 2025. Skyworks is enabling these opportunities with highly customized system solutions supporting a broad set of wireless protocols including cellular LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth®, LoRa, Thread and Zigbee®.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">5</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017/Image_001.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Looking ahead to 5G, we see a market that presents a massive growth opportunity for our industry and certainly for Skyworks. 5G data rates will approach ten to 100 times the fastest 4G speeds of today with near zero latency. To put this in perspective, downloading a full-length HD movie in 3G took one day; in 4G, the same file took minutes. On a 5G network, this content will be downloaded in mere seconds. By 2020 a single autonomous car is expected to consume 4,000 gigabytes of data per day in real-time diagnostics, positioning and vehicle-to-vehicle communications—that is equivalent to the daily data consumed by more than 2,000 smartphone users in 2017.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We expect the key catalysts for Skyworks to be the insatiable demand for data and the profitable usage model for both Mobile and IoT applications—as each connection becomes more valuable and vital particularly as the world embraces 5G.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Solving Connectivity Challenges</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The transition to ubiquitous connectivity, however, does not come without challenges to existing architectures. RF solutions in ultra-thin, high performance consumer products must increase data rates, solve signal interference problems, and occupy minimal board space while at the same time increasing battery life. Meeting these design challenges requires broad competencies including signal transmission and conditioning, the ability to ensure seamless hand-offs between multiple standards, power management, voltage regulation, battery charging, filtering and tuning, among others. This complexity plays directly to our strengths. We have a strong heritage in analog systems design and have spent the last decade investing in key technologies and resources. We are at the forefront of advanced multi-chip module integration and offer unmatched technology breadth, providing deep expertise in CMOS, SOI, GaAs and filters, and maintain strategic partnerships with outside independent wafer fabrication facilities, called foundries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">SKYWORKS’ STRATEGY</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our ambitious vision is to connect everyone and everything, all the time.

In addition to protecting our intellectual property, we strive to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio to enhance our ability to obtain cross-licenses of intellectual property from others, to obtain access to intellectual property we do not possess and to more favorably resolve potential intellectual property claims against us. Due to rapid technological changes in the industry, we believe establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position depends primarily on our ability to develop new, innovative products through the technical competence of our engineering personnel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The competitive environment in the semiconductor industry is in a constant state of flux, with new products continually emerging and existing products approaching technological obsolescence. We compete on the basis of time-to-market, new product innovation, quality, performance, price, compliance with industry standards, strategic relationships with customers and baseband vendors, personnel and protection of our intellectual property. We participate in highly competitive markets against numerous competitors that may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the semiconductor industry. Consistent with trends in the industry, we anticipate that average selling prices for our established products will continue to decline over time. We mitigate the gross margin impact of declining average selling prices with efforts to increase unit volumes, reduce material costs and lower manufacturing costs of existing products and by introducing new and higher value-added products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our products and markets demand rapid technological advancements requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and develop new products and technologies. Accordingly, we maintain a high level of research and development activity. We invested $355.2 million, $312.4 million and $303.2 million in research and development during fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. The growth in research and development expenses were the result of increases in our internal product designs and product development activity for our target markets in each of these fiscal years. Our research and development expenses include new product development and innovations in integrated circuit design, investment in advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, development of new packaging and test capabilities and research on next generation technologies and product opportunities. We maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">RAW MATERIALS</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Raw materials for our products and manufacturing processes are generally available from several sources. It is our intent not to depend on a sole source of supply unless market or other conditions dictate otherwise. However, there are limited situations where we procure certain components and services for our products from single or limited sources, and we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole source suppliers. We purchase materials and services primarily pursuant to individual purchase orders. However, we have entered into certain supply agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other manufacturing related services that specify minimum prices and purchase quantity based on our anticipated future requirements. Such amounts are reviewed and included in our contractual obligations and commitments as required. Certain of our suppliers consign raw materials to us at our manufacturing facilities to which we take title to as needed in our manufacturing process. We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">BACKLOG AND INVENTORY</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our sales are made pursuant to standard purchase orders and specified customer contracts for delivery of products, with such purchase orders officially acknowledged by us according to our own terms and conditions. We also maintain Skyworks-owned finished goods inventory at certain customer “hub” locations. We do not recognize revenue until these customers consume the Skyworks-owned inventory from these hub locations. Due to industry practice, which allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice to us prior to shipment, and with little or no penalty, we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volume could result in a reduction in revenue and us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, and other activities affecting the environment have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our manufacturing operations. Most of our customers have mandated that our products comply with various local, regional and national “green” initiatives initiated by</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017/Image_005.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">such customers or the locations in which they operate. We believe that our current expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection, and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims, will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial condition. Environmental regulations are subject to change in the future, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SEASONALITY</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sales of our products are subject to seasonal fluctuation and periods of increased demand in end-user consumer applications, such as smartphones and tablet computing devices. The highest demand for our products generally occurs in our first fiscal quarter ending in December and the fourth fiscal quarter ending in September. The lowest demand for our handset products generally occurs in our second fiscal quarter ending in March.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For information regarding net revenue by geographic region for each of the last three fiscal years, see<span class="s1">Note 16</span> to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EMPLOYEES</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of September 29, 2017, we employed approximately 8,400 employees world-wide. Approximately 1,000 of our employees in Mexico, 250 employees in Singapore, and 200 employees in Japan are covered by collective bargaining and other union agreements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially impacted by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time may impair our business operations, financial condition or results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets. Uncertain worldwide economic conditions, together with other factors such as the volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Uncertainty and economic weakness could result in a market contraction and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, bad debt, inventory charges, restructuring charges, and asset impairment charges. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations beyond our current fiscal year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our operating results may be adversely affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our revenues, earnings and other operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis. These fluctuations are typically the result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These factors include, among others:</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">changes in end-user demand for the products (principally smartphones) manufactured and sold by our customers,</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the gain or loss of significant customers,</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">new product and technology introductions by competitors,</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">increasing industry consolidation among our competitors,</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">changes in the mix of products produced and sold,</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">market acceptance of our products and our customer’s products, and</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 255pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">10</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017/Image_006.png"/></span></p></body></html>
