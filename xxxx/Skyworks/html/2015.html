We compete on the basis of time-to-market, new product innovation, quality, performance, price, compliance with industry standards, strategic relationships with customers and baseband vendors, personnel and protection of our intellectual property. We participate in highly competitive markets against numerous competitors that may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the semiconductor industry. Consistent with trends in the industry, we anticipate that average selling prices for our established products will continue to decline at a normalized rate of five to ten percent per year. As part of our normal course of business, we mitigate the gross margin impact of declining average selling prices with efforts to increase unit volumes, reduce material costs and lower manufacturing costs of existing products and by introducing new and higher value-added products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our products and markets demand rapid technological advancements requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and develop new products and technologies. Accordingly, we maintain a high level of research and development activity. We invested $303.2 million, $252.2 million and $226.3 million in research and development activities during fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 were the result of increases in our internal product designs and product development activity for our target markets in each of these fiscal years. Our research and development activities include new product development and innovations in integrated circuit design, investment in advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, development of new packaging and test capabilities and research on next generation technologies and product opportunities. We maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">RAW MATERIALS</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Raw materials for our products and manufacturing processes are generally available from several sources. It is our policy not to depend on a sole source of supply unless market or other conditions dictate otherwise. However, there are limited situations where we procure certain components and services for our products from single or limited sources, and we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole source suppliers. We purchase materials and services primarily pursuant to individual purchase orders. However, we have entered into certain supply agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other manufacturing related services that specify minimum prices and purchase quantity based on our anticipated future requirements. Such amounts are reviewed and included in our contractual obligations and commitments as required. Certain of our suppliers consign raw materials to us at our manufacturing facilities to which we take title to as needed in our manufacturing process. We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">BACKLOG AND INVENTORY</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our sales are made pursuant to standard purchase orders and/or specified customer contracts for delivery of products, with such purchase orders officially acknowledged by us according to our own terms and conditions. We also maintain Skyworks-owned finished goods inventory at certain customer “hub” locations. We do not recognize revenue until these customers consume the Skyworks-owned inventory from these hub locations. Due to industry practice, which allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice to us prior to shipment, and with little or no penalty, we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volume could result in a reduction in revenue and us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, and other activities affecting the environment have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our manufacturing operations. Most of our customers have mandated that our products comply with various local, regional and national “green” initiatives initiated by our customers or the locations in which they operate. We believe that our current expenditures for environmental capital investment</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_005.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection, and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims, will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial condition. Environmental regulations are subject to change in the future, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SEASONALITY</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sales of our products are subject to seasonal fluctuation and periods of increased demand in end-user consumer applications, such as smartphones and tablet computing devices. The highest demand for our products generally occurs in our first fiscal quarter ending in December and the lowest demand for our handset products generally occurs in our second fiscal quarter ending in March.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For information regarding net revenue by geographic region for each of the last three fiscal years, see Note 16 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EMPLOYEES</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of October 2, 2015, we employed approximately 6,700 employees world-wide. Approximately 770 of our employees in Mexico and 150 employees in Japan are covered by collective bargaining agreements and other union agreements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially impacted by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us present significant risks to our business at this time and may impair our business operations, financial condition or results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets. Uncertain worldwide economic conditions, together with other factors such as the volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Although we believe that the market for our semiconductor products has stabilized to some extent, continued uncertainty and economic weakness could result in a market contraction and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, bad debt, inventory and restructuring and/or asset impairment charges. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations beyond our current fiscal year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our operating results may be adversely affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our revenues, earnings and other operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis. These fluctuations are typically the result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These factors include, among others:</p><ul id="l2"><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">changes in end-user demand for the products (principally smartphones) manufactured and sold by our customers,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">availability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the gain or loss of significant customers,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">new product and technology introductions by competitors,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">changes in the mix of products produced and sold,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">market acceptance of our products and our customers,</p></li></ul></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 255pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">10</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_006.png"/></span></p></body></html>
