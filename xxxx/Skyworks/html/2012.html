This phenomenon has and continues to radically change the way we live, work and play as well as how we communicate. Given that the initial proliferation of these technologies is taking place predominantly in developed countries, we expect further worldwide penetration over the coming years. In fact, according to a June 2012 market research report from Infonetics, the number of global mobile broadband subscribers is expected to grow from 846 million in 2011 to over 2.5 billion subscribers by 2016. In a September 2012 report, the research firm NPD Group said it expects that annual shipments of smartphones, which are at the heart of the mobile Internet, will surpass one billion units by 2016, up from 491 million units in 2011. Similarly, annual shipments of computing tablets, a lower cost alternative to personal computers, are expected to grow significantly, from 73 million units in 2011 as estimated by NPD in a January 2012 report to over 250 million units by 2016. Today&#39;s smartphones and tablets can seamlessly take and share pictures, download music, connect to social media networks, provide GPS navigation, stream videos, enable video conferencing, provide voice support services and advice and access a host of Web-based content and applications. This list of ever increasing features and functionalities is delivered in ever thinner platforms with need for extended battery life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, content providers such as Google Inc., Microsoft Corporation, HBO (a division of Time Warner, Inc.), and Amazon.com, Inc., are building massive libraries of cloud-based, on-demand content. The result is an exploding desire to be connected to the cloud for both entertainment content and personal storage. Supporting cloud- based services requires adding Bluetooth, HSPA, Wi-Fi, GPS and ZigBee® technologies to 2G, 3G and 4G air interface capabilities and embedding them into products ranging from smartphones to tablets, media players and set top boxes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">5</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012/Image_001.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All of this activity is stressing traditional infrastructure networks. According to Cisco Systems, Inc.&#39;s 2012 VNI global IP traffic forecast, or the Cisco Report, traffic from wireless networking and mobile access is expected to exceed traffic from wireline devices by 2014, with mobile data expected to increase 18-fold between 2011 and 2016. The significant increase in traffic is being driven by more Internet users and exploding video content. The Cisco Report projects there will be nearly 18.9 billion network connections, almost 2.5 connections for each person on earth, compared to 10.3 billion in 2011 and that by 2016, 1.2 million minutes of video, the equivalent of 833 days, will travel the Internet every second.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">High Performance Analog Semiconductors</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Outside of the smartphone and tablet markets, wireless technologies are growing across a number of new and exciting vertical applications. The market for analog semiconductors, characterized by longer product lifecycles and relatively high gross margins, is fragmented and diversified spanning a wide variety of end markets including smart energy, power management and machine-to-machine applications, to name just a few.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Smart Energy</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Following a decade of promise, smart energy is poised to grow significantly. According to a 2010 study by ABI Research, cumulative global investment in smart grids will exceed $45 billion by 2015, as both governments and utilities repair, upgrade and transform their aging energy supply and transmission infrastructure. Smart grids offer utilities real-time, two-way communications with each segment of the electrical grid, assessing loads, usage, and efficiency twenty-four hours a day. Much of the developed world relies on energy transmission technology and infrastructure that was built between 60 to 80 years ago, and it&#39;s beginning to show its age, particularly as consumers experience usage restrictions and brownouts globally. Home and building automation applications in particular are beginning to gain real momentum given consumer demand for green technologies, enhanced security and energy conservation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Power Management</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Power management also provides us with significant growth and diversification opportunities, representing a market potential itself of approximately $2 billion for camera flash drivers and related analog devices in smartphones, as well as products in e-book readers and displays, cable modems and LED lighting. For example, the adoption of cameras in smartphones, along with consumers&#39; expectations for high-quality photographs, is driving accelerated implementation of camera flash drivers in mobile platforms. According to Gartner, Inc., in its September 2011 Market Trends: Digital Camera Function in Mobile and Consumers Electronics report, or the Gartner Camera Report, mobile phone cameras will grow from approximately 1.6 billion units in 2011 to over 2.2 billion units by 2015, penetrating 92 percent of mobile phones worldwide.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Machine to Machine</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Beyond connecting places and people, the next phase of the Internet&#39;s evolution will be to connect things. Commonly referred to as machine-to-machine connectivity, the internet of things or hyper connectivity, connecting things is based on the simple principle that anything that can be connected to the network will be connected to the network. Smaller, more powerful processors, the growing availability of LTE, higher resolution sensors, and technologies such as thin-film and embedded software are helping make machine- to-machine a reality. In fact, according to an October 2012 Scotiabank report, Ericsson estimates that by 2020 there will be 50 billion machines connected to the Internet, versus an estimated 140 million today. In that same report, Scotiabank estimates that by 2022, there will be 6.1 billion devices with a cellular connection to the network with 2.3 billion added that same year. Scotiabank also believes automotive and medical business sectors will likely be the biggest markets in machine-to-machine connectivity, expected to represent an estimated $1.2 trillion by 2020. For example, while only roughly 5% of cars have mobile communications today, within three to five years, all new cars are expected to have mobile connections. The automobile, in particular, encompasses an array of solutions that connectivity would allow from public safety and reduced fuel consumption to enhanced entertainment features and increased integration into one&#39;s smartphone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each of these macro trends represents significant growth opportunities for Skyworks given our differentiated product portfolio, scale, original equipment manufacturer relationships and integration skill sets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SKYWORKS&#39; STRATEGY</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Skyworks&#39; overall strategy is to enable mobile connectivity through semiconductor innovation.

For further information regarding concentrations see Note 18 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We own or have a license to use numerous United States and foreign patents and patent applications related to our products, our manufacturing operations and processes, and our other activities. In addition, we own a number of trademarks and service marks applicable to certain of our products and services. We believe that our intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trade secrets and trademarks, is of material importance to our business. We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our confidential and proprietary technologies, devices, algorithms, processes and other intellectual property. Our efforts may not meaningfully protect our intellectual property, and others may independently develop substantially equivalent or superior proprietary technologies, devices, algorithms, processes or other intellectual property. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and effective copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in those jurisdictions. In addition to protecting our intellectual property, we strive to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio to enhance our ability to obtain cross-licenses of intellectual property from others, to obtain access to intellectual property we do not possess and to more favorably resolve potential intellectual property claims against us. Furthermore, we seek to generate high gross margin revenue through the sale and license of non-core intellectual property and we occasionally purchase intellectual property. Due to rapid technological changes in the industry, we believe establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position depends primarily on our ability to develop new innovative products through the technical competence of our engineering personnel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The competitive environment in the semiconductor industry is in a constant state of flux, with new products continually emerging and existing products approaching technological obsolescence. We compete on the basis of time-to-market, new product innovation, quality, performance, price, compliance with industry standards, strategic relationships with customers and baseband vendors, personnel and protection of our intellectual property. We participate in highly competitive markets against numerous competitors that may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our products and markets demand rapid technological advancements requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and develop new products and technologies. Accordingly, we maintain a high level of research and development activity. We invested $212.5 million, $168.6 million and $134.1 million in research and development activities during the fiscal years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011, and October 1, 2010, respectively. The increase in research and development expense is a result of the additional headcount and development activities associated with the acquisitions of AATI and SiGe, as well as</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012/Image_005.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">increases in our internal product design and development for our target markets. Our research and development activities include new product development and innovations in integrated circuit design, investment in advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, developing new packaging and test capabilities and researching next generation technologies and product opportunities. We maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RAW MATERIALS</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Raw materials for our products and manufacturing processes are generally available from several sources. It is our policy not to depend on a sole source of supply unless market or other conditions dictate otherwise. Consequently, there are limited situations where we procure certain components and services for our products from single or limited sources. We purchase materials and services primarily pursuant to individual purchase orders. However, we have entered into certain supply agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other manufacturing related services that specify minimum prices and purchase quantity based on our anticipated future requirements. Certain of our suppliers consign raw materials to us at our manufacturing facilities which we take title to as needed in our manufacturing process. We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BACKLOG AND INVENTORY</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our sales are made pursuant to standard purchase orders and/or specified customer contracts for delivery of products, with such purchase orders officially acknowledged by us according to our own terms and conditions. We also maintain Skyworks-owned finished goods inventory at certain customer “hub” locations. We do not recognize revenue until these customers consume the Skyworks-owned inventory from these hub locations. Due to industry practice, which allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice to us prior to shipment, and with little or no penalty, we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volume could result in a reduction in revenue and us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, and other activities affecting the environment have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our manufacturing operations. Most of our customers have mandated that our products comply with various local, regional and national “green” initiatives initiated by our customers or the locations in which they operate. We believe that our current expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection, and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims, will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial condition.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Environmental regulations are subject to change in the future, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SEASONALITY</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales of our products are subject to seasonal fluctuation and periods of increased demand in end-user consumer applications, such as smartphones and tablet computing devices. The highest demand for our products generally occurs in our first fiscal quarter ending in December. The lowest demand for our handset products generally occurs in our second fiscal quarter.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For information regarding net revenue by geographic region for each of the last three fiscal years, see Note 18 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EMPLOYEES</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of September 28, 2012, we employed approximately 4,700 employees world-wide (as compared to 4,400 as of September 30, 2011). Approximately 550 of our employees in Mexico are covered by collective bargaining agreements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 255pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">10</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012/Image_006.png"/></span></p></body></html>
