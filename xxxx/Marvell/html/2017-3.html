Our core strength of expertise is the development of complex System-on-a-Chip (“SoC”) devices, leveraging our technology portfolio of intellectual property in the areas of analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, and embedded and standalone integrated circuits. We also develop integrated hardware platforms along with software that incorporates digital computing technologies designed and configured to provide an optimized computing solution. Our broad product portfolio includes devices for storage, networking and connectivity. We were incorporated in Bermuda in January 1995.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Our registered and mailing address is Canon’s Court, 22 Victoria Street, Hamilton HM 12, Bermuda, and our telephone number there is (441) 296-6395. The address of our U.S. operating subsidiary is Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., 5488 Marvell Lane, Santa Clara, California 95054, and our telephone number there is</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(408) 222-2500. We also have operations in many countries, including China, India, Israel, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Available Information</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.marvell.com/" class="a" target="_blank">Our website address is located at </a>www.marvell.com. The information contained on our website does not form any part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated by reference herein. We make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file this material with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our Markets and Products</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Over the last several years, we have transitioned from a supplier of stand-alone semiconductor components to a supplier of fully integrated platform solutions. Our platform solutions contain multiple intellectual property components in integrated hardware, along with software that incorporates digital, analog and mixed-signal computing and communication technologies, designed and configured to provide an optimized solution. Our solutions have become increasingly integrated, with more and more components resulting in an all-in-one solution for a given customer’s end product. The demand for such highly integrated platform solutions is generally driven by technological changes and anticipation of the future needs of device manufacturers and end users, including enterprises, campus and service provider networks and, to an increasing extent, data center providers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">A device manufacturer may require technologies leveraged from one end market product into products for other end markets, integrating components and technologies traditionally associated with one end market with components and technologies from another end market. The integration of these various technologies onto a single piece of silicon is referred to as SoC.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">In addition, software has become increasingly important to our business over the last several years and we believe software will become even more relevant as the market expects hardware and software to be delivered as an integrated solution offering. On-chip software, which acts as the “driver” for the functionality of the chip, has always been a critical part of our business. However, the software and application-level software that we deliver with our products has become significantly more complex as the range of uses and the needs has increased. For example, a solution that we develop for storage or networking can contain software that has a range of functionalities built in. Alternatively, our solution can allow our customers to deploy their operative systems on top of our chip, as well as deploy their application software on top of our SoC.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Our current product offerings are primarily in three broad product groups: storage, networking and connectivity. In storage, we are a market leader in data storage controller solutions spanning consumer, mobile, desktop and enterprise markets. Our storage solutions enable customers to engineer high-volume products for hard disk drives and solid state drives. Our networking products address end markets in cloud, enterprise, small and medium business and service provider networks. Our connectivity products address end markets in consumer, enterprise, desktop, service provider networks and automotive. Our storage, networking and connectivity products power cutting-edge networks and data centers around the world. The networking &amp; connectivity product groups were previously referred to as smart networked devices and solutions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">2</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017-3/Image_001.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In connection with the November 2016 announcement of our plan to restructure our operations to refocus our research and development, increase operational efficiency and improve profitability, we also plan to divest certain businesses and we began an active program to locate buyers for several businesses. As of January 28, 2017, two of these businesses were classified as discontinued operations. As required, we retrospectively recast our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets for all periods presented to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations. Unless noted otherwise, the following discussion refers to our continuing operations. Our net revenue by product group for the last three fiscal years is as follows:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left:

Seasonality, including holiday and back to school buying trends, may at times negatively impact our results in the first and fourth quarter, and positively impact our results in the second and third quarter of our fiscal years. In addition, the timing of new product introductions by our customers may cause variations in our quarterly revenues, which may not be indicative of future trends.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Inventory and Working Capital</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">We place firm orders for products with our suppliers generally up to 16 weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date and typically prior to an order for the product. These lead times typically change based on the current capacity at the foundries. We often maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. In addition, increased use of “hubs” managed by third-party logistics providers has resulted in a higher number of inventory locations and higher overall inventory levels.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We do not believe that backlog is a meaningful or reliable indicator for future demand, due to the following:</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">an industry practice that allows customers to cancel or change orders prior to the scheduled shipment dates;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">an increasing portion of our revenue comes from products shipped to customers using third-party logistics providers, or “hubs” wherein the product can be pulled at any time by the customer and is therefore never reflected in backlog; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">scheduled future shipments include shipments to distributors for which we do not recognize revenue until the products are sold to end customers.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">We believe that our future success depends on our ability to introduce improvements to our existing products and to develop new products that deliver cost- effective solutions for both existing and new markets. Our research and development efforts are directed largely to the development of high-performance analog, mixed- signal, digital signal processing and embedded microprocessor integrated circuits with the smallest die size and lowest power. We devote a significant portion of our resources to expanding our product portfolio based on a broad intellectual property portfolio with designs that enable high-performance, reliable communications over a variety of physical transmission media. We are also focused on incorporating functions currently provided by stand-alone integrated circuits into our integrated platform solutions to reduce our customers’ overall system costs.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">We have assembled a core team of engineers who have experience in the areas of mixed-signal circuit design, digital signal processing, embedded microprocessors, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (“CMOS”) technology and system-level architectures. We have invested and will continue to invest a significant amount of funds for research and development. Our research and development expense was $0.8 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See our discussion of research and development expenses in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">5</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017-3/Image_008.png"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Integrated Circuit Fabrication</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">The vast majority of our integrated circuits are fabricated using widely available CMOS processes, which provide greater flexibility to engage independent foundries to manufacture integrated circuits at lower costs. By outsourcing manufacturing, we are able to avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility. This allows us to focus our efforts on the design and marketing of our products. We currently outsource a large percentage of our integrated circuit manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. We also utilize United Microelectronics Corporation, with the remaining manufacturing outsourced to other foundries located primarily in Asia. We work closely with our foundry partners to forecast on a monthly basis our manufacturing capacity requirements. We closely monitor foundry production to ensure consistent overall quality, reliability and yield levels. Our integrated circuits are currently fabricated in several advanced manufacturing processes. Because finer manufacturing processes lead to enhanced performance, smaller silicon chip size and lower power requirements, we continually evaluate the benefits and feasibility of migrating to smaller geometry process technology in order to reduce cost and improve performance.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Assembly and Test</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">We outsource all product packaging and testing requirements for our products in production to several assembly and test subcontractors primarily located in China, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Environmental Management</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">We believe that our products comply with the current Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the European legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead, and the Regulation, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals SVHC Substances Directive. In addition, each of our manufacturing subcontractors complies with ISO 14001:2004, the international standard related to environmental management. We are also working to establish a “conflict-free” supply chain, including ethical sourcing of certain minerals for our products.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intellectual Property</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Our future revenue growth and overall success depend in large part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions, confidentiality agreements and licenses to protect our intellectual property. As of January 28, 2017, we have approximately 8,700 U.S. and foreign patents issued and approximately 2,000 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending on various aspects of our technology. While we believe the duration of of our patents generally covers the expected lives of our products, our patents may not collectively or individually cover every feature on innovation in our product. In addition, our efforts may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation or infringement. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our patents and intellectual property.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">We have expended and will continue to expend considerable resources in establishing a patent position designed to protect our intellectual property. While our ability to compete is enhanced by our ability to protect our intellectual property, we believe that in view of the rapid pace of technological change, the combination of the technical experience and innovative skills of our employees may be as important to our business as the legal protection of our patents and other proprietary information.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">From time to time, we may desire or be required to renew or to obtain licenses from third parties in order to further develop and effectively market commercially viable products or in connection with a pending or future claim or action asserted against us. We cannot be sure that any necessary licenses will be available or will be available on commercially reasonable terms.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">The integrated circuit industry is characterized by vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in significant and often time consuming and expensive litigation. From time to time, we receive, and may continue to receive in the future, notices that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused the proprietary rights of other parties.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">In addition, we have in the past and may in the future be sued by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets, or who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents. Although we defend these claims vigorously, it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “Note 10 — Commitments and Contingencies” in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the risks associated with patent litigation matters.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">The markets for our products, particularly in networking and connectivity, are intensely competitive, and are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and pricing</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">6</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017-3/Image_009.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pressures. Competition has intensified as a result of the increasing demand for higher levels of performance and integration and smaller process geometries. We expect competition to intensify as current competitors continue to strengthen the depth and breadth of their product offerings, either through in-house development or by acquiring existing technology. We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for our products depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">The performance, features, quality and price of our products;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">The timing and success of new product introductions by us, our customers and our competitors;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Emergence, rate of adoption and acceptance of new industry standards;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Our ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity with the appropriate technological capability; and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">The number and nature of our competitors in a given market.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Our major competitors for our products include Broadcom Limited, Cavium, Inc., MediaTek, Inc., QUALCOMM, Inc., Quantenna Communications Inc. and Silicon Motion Technology Corporation. We expect increased competition in the future from emerging or established companies, or alliances among competitors, customers or other third parties, any of which could acquire significant market share. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of competitive risks associated with our business.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Historically, average unit selling prices in the integrated circuit industry in general, and for our products in particular, have decreased over the life of a particular product. We expect that the average unit selling prices of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures. In order to offset expected declines in the selling prices of our products, we will need to continue to introduce innovative new products and reduce the cost of our products. To accomplish this, we intend to continue to implement design changes that lower the cost of manufacturing, assembly and testing of our products. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of pricing risks.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of January 28, 2017, we had a total of 4,617 employees.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Item 1A. <span class="s1">Risk Factors</span></h1><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Investing in our common shares involves a high degree of risk.
