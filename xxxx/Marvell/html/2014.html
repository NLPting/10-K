As transistor line widths shrink over time, transistor density increases proportionally, enabling the manufacture of ever more complex devices in a fixed area of silicon. This phenomenon, known as “Moore’s Law,” states that with the transition to each new successive process node, transistor device size will shrink by 0.7×. This can enable a 2× increase in the number of transistors, an increase in device performance, a reduction in chip size, or additional functionality. Furthermore, the transition to ever smaller process geometries results in proportionally lower power consumption of integrated circuits.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The effect of Moore’s Law on the semiconductor industry has been a rapid increase in the processing speed, the device density of integrated circuits and improved power efficiency. This has enabled the integration of multiple complex functions onto a single piece of silicon, which in the past required multiple discrete integrated circuits. Concurrently, with the advances in semiconductor technology, there has been an evolutionary shift</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">3</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">toward standards-based communication interconnect protocols, such as Ethernet and wireless local area network (“LAN”). This has given rise to a large number of diverse electronic systems suppliers that address the simultaneous transmission of voice, video, audio and data through both wired and wireless connections.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Technological innovations have increased the capability to transmit and process information, which has led to both business enterprise and consumer electronic devices sharing and communicating ever larger amounts of information for a wide array of applications. Due in part to the ongoing evolution of both semiconductor and communications technology, the bandwidth demanded by users has continued to expand at an exponential rate. Additionally, as the bandwidth demand from service providers, enterprises and consumers has risen, there has been a commensurate increase in the required amount of data storage capacity. We believe the market effects enabled by the advances in both semiconductor and communication technologies will provide a large and growing market for our products, technologies and intellectual property capabilities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Within most modern electronic systems, the device interconnects and data transmission occurs within the analog signal domain. However, due to advanced technologies, modern systems approaches and new algorithms, most new products convert the analog signals into digital signals to process the information. Given the high volume and cost sensitive nature of current electronic devices, it is very beneficial to be able to integrate many of the analog and digital functions onto a single integrated circuit, which can help to increase system performance, lower costs and lower overall power consumption. As a result, these devices require a combination of both analog and digital integrated circuit technologies, more commonly known as mixed-signal technology. Historically, the ability to manufacture mixed-signal technologies required the use of expensive, non-scalable semiconductor manufacturing process technologies. However, to achieve price points that will accelerate the acceptance of these highly integrated mixed-signal devices, a small number of semiconductor suppliers, including us, have invested in the fundamental research and development capability, which allows for the use of high volume, lower cost and scalable complementary metal oxide semiconductor (“CMOS”) fabrication technology.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Because the processing requirements of these mixed-signal integrated circuits continue to expand with the increased performance and sophistication of the devices in which they are embedded, many of these integrated circuits are now also integrating high-performance embedded microprocessors and complex digital signal processors to handle the increased workload. With improvements in the performance of such embedded microprocessors, devices can further expand their capabilities while at the same time minimizing power requirements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Many of these new, sophisticated devices are also handheld battery-powered devices in which minimizing power consumption is critical to maximizing the life of the battery. Utilizing highly integrated circuits that are optimized for power efficiency is a critical factor for such handheld devices. Additionally, advanced digital power management solutions that regulate the power supply to the integrated circuits in an efficient and cost-effective manner are becoming increasingly important to the reduction of both the overall power consumption and the total size of the solution.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Platform Solutions</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Over the last several years, we have transitioned from a supplier of standalone semiconductor components to a supplier of fully integrated platform solutions. Our platform solutions contain multiple intellectual property components in integrated hardware along with software that incorporates digital, analog and mixed-signal computing and communication technologies, designed and configured to provide an optimized solution compared to individual components. Our solutions have become increasingly integrated, with ever more components resulting in an all-in-one solution for a given customer’s end product. The demand for such highly integrated platform solutions is generally driven by technological changes and anticipation of the future needs of the device manufacturer and end user, as well as to an increasing extent by service providers, including cellular network carriers and Internet based applications providers. For example, in order to provide a complete solution for a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">4</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">specific handheld consumer electronics device, a device manufacturer may require a solution that integrates a high-performance applications processor, along with seamless communications capability with a 3G/4G Long-Term Evolution (“LTE”) multi-band modem, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, radio frequency (“RF”), GPS and near field communication (“NFC”). In addition, a device manufacturer may require high-definition graphics processing, high-definition video and audio, and power management. These platforms will often cross multiple end markets, integrating components and technologies traditionally associated with one end market with components and technologies from another end market. For example, we may integrate an applications processor, traditionally associated with the mobile and wireless end market, with software and other components in an end user product targeting the home cloud. Therefore, it has become critical that our products across multiple end markets work together seamlessly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">In addition, software has become increasingly important to our business over the last several years, and we expect software to become even more important in the years to come. On-chip software, which acts as the “driver” for the functionality of the chip, has always been a critical part of our business. However, the software that we deliver with our chip has become significantly more complex as the range of uses and the needs in application-level software have increased. For example, a chip that we develop for a smartphone may need to include software that is compatible with the latest version of a specific company’s operating system that enables 3D user interface and graphics, and that works seamlessly with a variety of popular end user applications. These demands require a significant amount of up-front software development, testing, and often additional licensing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Lastly, the market for consumer electronics devices is becoming increasingly standards-based. These standards change rapidly and often several different standards may exist and overlap in a single market. Our platforms are typically designed to operate seamlessly with all relevant standards, which require us to design products in anticipation of these relevant standards. For example, we have communications processors and software designed to operate on several different cellular standards, including GSM/ enhanced data for the GSM environment (“EDGE”) (2G), WCDMA (3G), TD-SCDMA (China 3G) and 4G LTE.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">In summary, while providing the most advanced components at the lowest possible price remains critical to our business, continuing the transformation into a platform solutions provider through the integration of multiple components together with industry-leading software capability will continue to increase in importance to our overall success.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our Markets and Products</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">During the early stages of the company, our core technologies were focused on the storage market. Today, we provide high-performance products for traditional hard disk drive (“HDD”) controllers to companies such as Seagate Technology, Toshiba Corporation and Western Digital Corporation. Over the past few years, we have expanded our core storage technologies by developing solid state flash drive (“SSD”) controllers, which are currently sold to flash providers, such as Micron, SanDisk and Toshiba and other companies who are building drives based on our SSD technologies. In addition, we have also developed unique high-performance solutions for the solid state hybrid drive (“SSHD”) market, which we expect to grow rapidly over the next few years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">As our business grew, we expanded into the networking market, where we developed industry-leading PHY devices and wired and wireless Ethernet-switching solutions, which enable high-speed transmission between communications systems that are sold by manufacturers of networking and wireless equipment, such as Brocade Communication Systems, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., FREEBOX, Hewlett Packard Company, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Intel Corporation, Juniper Networks, Inc. and ZTE Corporation. We also provide complete smartphone and tablet platform solutions, including communications and applications processors, wireless connectivity, power management and other platform components, for customers such as BlackBerry, Huawei, Motorola Solutions, Samsung, Yulong and ZTE Corporation. We also provide printer SoC and system level solutions, including wireless, for both inkjet and laser jet printer systems for companies including Hewlett Packard Company. Our wireless products also are used on a standalone basis in consumer electronics devices,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">5</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">including smartphones, tablets, wireless access routers and gaming devices, by companies such as Cisco Systems, Microsoft Corporation, Samsung and Sony Corporation. In addition, we also provide video and application processors combined with our connectivity and power management for new consumer devices, such as the Google Chromecast.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our current product offerings are primarily in three broad end markets: mobile and wireless, storage and networking. Our net revenue by end market for the last three fiscal years are as follows:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:5.30134pt"

Because of the scheduling requirements of our foundries, we generally place firm orders for products with our suppliers generally up to 16 weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date and typically prior to an order for the product. These lead times typically change based on the current capacity at the foundries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">A significant number of our products are being incorporated into consumer electronics products, including gaming devices and personal computers, which are subject to significant seasonality and fluctuations in demand. Holiday and back to school buying trends may at times negatively impact our results in the first and fourth quarter and positively impact our results in the second and third quarter of our fiscal years. In addition, the timing of new product introductions by our customers may cause variations in our quarterly revenues, which may not be indicative of future trends.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. The quantities actually purchased by the customer, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer’s needs. Due to an industry practice that allows customers to cancel or change purchase orders with limited notice prior to the scheduled shipment dates, we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenue. In addition, an increasing portion of our revenue is related to inventory pulled by customers from third-party logistics providers. As such, this revenue would not be included in the backlog. Our backlog also includes orders from distributors for which revenue is not recognized until the products are sold to end customers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We believe that our future success depends on our ability to introduce improvements to our existing products and to develop new products that deliver cost- effective solutions for both existing and new markets. Our research and development efforts are directed largely to the development of high-performance analog, mixed- signal, digital signal processing and embedded microprocessor integrated circuits with the smallest die size and lowest power. We devote a significant portion of our resources to expanding our product portfolio based on a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 255pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">11</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">broad intellectual property portfolio with designs that enable high-performance, reliable communications over a variety of physical transmission media. We are also focused on incorporating functions currently provided by stand alone integrated circuits into our integrated platform solutions to reduce our customers’ overall system costs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We have assembled a core team of engineers who have extensive experience in the areas of mixed-signal circuit design, digital signal processing, embedded microprocessors, CMOS technology and system-level architectures. We have invested and will continue to invest significant funds for research and development. Our research and development expense was $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing</h1><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Integrated Circuit Fabrication</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The vast majority of our integrated circuits are fabricated using widely available CMOS processes, which provide greater flexibility to engage independent foundries to manufacture integrated circuits at lower costs. By outsourcing manufacturing, we are able to avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility. This allows us to focus our efforts on the design and marketing of our products. We currently outsource a substantial percentage of our integrated circuit manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. To a lesser extent, we also utilize United Microelectronics Corporation, with the remaining manufacturing outsourced to other foundries primarily in Asia. We work closely with our foundry partners to forecast on a monthly basis our manufacturing capacity requirements. Our integrated circuits are currently fabricated in several advanced manufacturing processes up to and including 28 nanometer. Because finer manufacturing processes lead to enhanced performance, smaller silicon chip size and lower power requirements, we continually evaluate the benefits and feasibility of migrating to smaller geometry process technology in order to reduce cost and improve performance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Assembly and Test</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We outsource all product packaging and testing requirements for our production products to several assembly and test subcontractors, including STATS ChipPAC Ltd. in China, Singapore and Taiwan; Global Testing Corporation in Taiwan; Siliconware Precision Industries in China and Taiwan; ASE Electronics in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan; and Amkor in Philippines, South Korea and Taiwan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Quality Assurance</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We are certified to the International Organization for Standardization Quality Management Systems Standard ISO 9001:2008. We build quality into our products starting with the design and development process. Our designs are subjected to extensive circuit simulation under extreme conditions of temperature, voltage and processing before being committed to manufacture. We pre-qualify each of our subcontractors and conduct regular in-depth quality audits. We closely monitor foundry production to ensure consistent overall quality, reliability and yield levels. All of our independent foundries and assembly-test subcontractors have been awarded</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ISO 9001 certification.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Environmental Management</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We believe that our products are compliant with the current Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the European legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead, and the REACH (Regulation, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals) SVHC Substances Directive. In addition, each of our manufacturing subcontractors complies with ISO 14001:2004, the international standard related to environmental management. We are also working to establish a “conflict-free” supply chain, including ethical sourcing of certain minerals for our products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 255pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">12</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intellectual Property</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our future revenue growth and overall success depend in large part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and licenses to protect our intellectual property. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, suppliers and customers and seek to control access to and distribution of, our documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products and technology without authorization, independently develop similar technology or design around our patents. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of other companies into our designs and we have certain obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of their intellectual property. It is possible, however, that the steps taken by us to prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or our customers’ intellectual property may not be successful.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">As of February 1, 2014, we have been issued and/or have acquired over 4,200 U.S. patents and over 1,200 foreign patents with expiration dates ranging from 2014 to 2034. We also have more than 2,700 U.S. and foreign pending patent applications on various aspects of our technology; however, we cannot be certain whether we will be issued patents as a result of these applications. Furthermore, it is possible that our patents may be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or licensed to others.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Additionally, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or proprietary information to the same extent as do the laws of the United States and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries. We may need to engage in litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or the rights of our customers, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We have expended and will continue to expend considerable resources in establishing a patent position designed to protect our intellectual property. While our ability to compete is enhanced by our ability to protect our intellectual property, we believe that in view of the rapid pace of technological change, the combination of the technical experience and innovative skills of our employees may be as important to our business as the legal protection of our patents and other proprietary information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">From time to time, we may desire or be required to renew or to obtain licenses from third parties in order to further develop and effectively market commercially viable products. We cannot be sure that any necessary licenses will be available or will be available on commercially reasonable terms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The integrated circuit industry is characterized by vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in significant and often time consuming and expensive litigation. From time to time, we receive, and may continue to receive in the future, notices that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused the proprietary rights of other parties. Although we defend these claims vigorously, it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits. In addition, we may be sued in the future by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets, or who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents. Any of these claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if claims against us are not valid or successfully asserted, these claims could result in significant costs and a diversion of management and personnel resources to defend. In that event, our business, financial condition and results of operations could also be materially and adversely affected. In any of the pending or future claims or actions asserted against us, we may seek to obtain licenses under a third party’s intellectual property rights; however, we may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

Although we believe we will be able to successfully compete with existing and potential competitors, some of these current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical and other resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changing customer demands or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can. Our current or future competitors could develop and introduce new products that will be priced lower, provide superior performance or achieve greater market acceptance than our products. In addition, in the event of a manufacturing capacity shortage, these competitors may be able to manufacture products when our ability to do so may be limited.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Furthermore, current or potential competitors have established or may establish financial and strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers or other third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of customers. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share, which could harm our business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">In addition, many of our current and potential customers have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources. Some customers have already developed, or in the future may develop, technologies that could compete directly with our products. We may also face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Historically, average unit selling prices in the integrated circuit industry in general, and for our products in particular, have decreased over the life of a particular product. We expect that the average unit selling prices of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 255pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">14</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures. In order to offset expected declines in the selling prices of our products, we will need to continue to introduce innovative new products. In addition, we need to continue to reduce the cost of our products. To accomplish this, we intend to continue to implement design changes that lower the cost of manufacturing and assembling and testing our products. We may also enter into long-term, strategic arrangements with our foundry partners to secure wafer capacity at reduced prices, by negotiating reduced charges from our foundries. In addition, we plan to work with multiple foundry partners to ensure that our products are qualified and can be manufactured in multiple locations, which we believe will ensure favorable wafer pricing. Because we do not operate our own manufacturing, assembly or testing facilities, we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities. If we fail to introduce lower cost versions of our products in a timely manner or to successfully manage our manufacturing, assembly and testing relationships, our business could be adversely impacted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of February 1, 2014, we had a total of 7,355 employees.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Executive Officers of the Registrant</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following table shows information about our executive officers as of March 20, 2014:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:5.30134pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:8pt"><td style="width:131pt"><p class="s2" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;">Name</p></td><td style="width:90pt"><p class="s2" style="padding-right: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: right;">Age</p></td><td style="width:307pt"><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;">Position(s)</p></td></tr><tr style="height:10pt"><td style="width:131pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Dr. Sehat Sutardja</p></td><td style="width:90pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="padding-right: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: right;">52</p></td><td style="width:307pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board</p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:131pt"><p class="s3" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Weili Dai</p></td><td style="width:90pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-right: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: right;">52</p></td><td style="width:307pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">President</p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:131pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Michael Rashkin</p></td><td style="width:90pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="padding-right: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: right;">68</p></td><td style="width:307pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Chief Financial Officer</p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:131pt"><p class="s3" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Dr. Zining Wu</p></td><td style="width:90pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-right: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: right;">41</p></td><td style="width:307pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Chief Technology Officer</p></td></tr></table><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Dr. Sehat Sutardja<span class="p">, one of our co-founders, has served as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors since 1995 (from 1995 to 2003 he was Co-Chairman of the Board of Directors).
