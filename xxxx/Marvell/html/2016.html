Our core strength of expertise is the development of complex System-on-a-Chip (“SoC”) and System-in-a-Package (“SiP”) devices, leveraging our extensive technology portfolio of intellectual property in the areas of analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, and embedded and standalone integrated circuits. The majority of our product portfolio leverages embedded central processing unit technology. We also develop platforms that we define as integrated hardware along with software that incorporates digital computing technologies designed and configured to provide an optimized computing solution. Our broad product portfolio includes devices for data storage, enterprise-class Ethernet data switching, Ethernet physical-layer transceivers (“PHY”), wireless connectivity, Internet-of-Things (“IoT”) devices and multimedia solutions. We were incorporated in Bermuda in January 1995.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our registered and mailing address is Canon’s Court, 22 Victoria Street, Hamilton HM 12, Bermuda, and our telephone number there is (441) 296-6395. The address of our U.S. operating subsidiary is Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., 5488 Marvell Lane, Santa Clara, California 95054, and our telephone number there is</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(408) 222-2500. We also have operations in many countries, including China, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. For example, the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 is referred to as fiscal 2016.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Available Information</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.marvell.com/" class="a" target="_blank">Our website address is located at </a>www.marvell.com. The information contained in our website does not form any part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, we make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file this material with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our Markets and Products</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Over the last several years, we have transitioned from a supplier of stand-alone semiconductor components to a supplier of fully integrated platform solutions. Our platform solutions contain multiple intellectual property components in integrated hardware along with software that incorporates digital, analog and mixed-signal computing and communication technologies, designed and configured to provide an optimized solution compared to individual components. Our solutions have become increasingly integrated, with more and more components resulting in an all-in-one solution for a given customer’s end product. The demand for such highly integrated platform solutions is generally driven by technological changes and anticipation of the future needs of device manufacturers and end users, as well as, to an increasing extent, service providers, including cellular network carriers and Internet-based applications providers. A device manufacturer may require high-definition graphics processing, high-definition video and audio, and power management. These platforms will often cross multiple end markets, integrating components and technologies traditionally associated with one end market with components and technologies from another end market. For example, we may integrate an applications processor, traditionally associated with the mobile and wireless end market, with software and other components in an end user product targeting the home cloud. Therefore, it has become critical that our products across multiple end markets work together seamlessly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The integration of these various technologies onto a single piece of silicon is referred to as SoC. The development of SoCs became in high demand over the past decade, with strong market presence in networking</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">2</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and cloud infrastructure, storage, multimedia and custom specific product solutions. We believe the development of SoCs will continue to grow as more complex chips can be delivered to the different end markets in the years to come.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">In addition, software has become increasingly important to our business over the last several years and we expect software to become even more relevant as the market expects hardware and software to be delivered as a solution offering. On-chip software, which acts as the “driver” for the functionality of the chip, has always been a critical part of our business. However, the software that we deliver with our chip has become significantly more complex as the range of uses and the needs in application-level software have increased. For example, a chip that we develop for storage or networking can contain software that already has functionalities included, or it can offer abilities that our customers deploy in their operative system on top of our chip, as well as deploying in application software on top of it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The products that we develop are targeted for several key end markets and applications: storage, networking and cloud infrastructure, wireless connectivity, multimedia and IoT. In storage, we are a market leader in data storage controller solutions spanning consumer, mobile, desktop and enterprise markets. Our storage solutions enable customers to engineer high-volume products for hard disk drives and solid state drives. In IoT, we develop flexible and cost-effective platforms that enable original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) and original design manufacturers (“ODM”) to quickly and cost-effectively reach the market with new, innovative products in this rapidly growing space. We provide a range of silicon and software solutions that enable applications such as wearables, home automation, home security, smart appliances and automotive. For networking and cloud infrastructure, our products and solutions are designed for reliability and resiliency. From robust enterprise networking applications to consumer and small business solutions, our cloud services products power every point in the cloud and networking ecosystem. Our storage, networking, multimedia, wireless connectivity and video processing products power cutting-edge consumer and digital entertainment devices, empowering consumers to manage and consume content at home or on the go.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All of our products are built on the foundation of innovation, and we continue to develop new and cutting-edge technology to enable our customers’ applications.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In fiscal 2016, we developed two technologies that have the potential to revolutionize integrated circuit design by decreasing the cost, complexity, power and form factor of next-generation systems and chips. Our Final-Level Cache (“FLC<span class="s2">TM</span>”) architecture redefines the main memory hierarchy by substantially reducing the amount of dynamic random access memory needed in a system. Our Modular Chip (“MoChi <span class="s2">TM</span>”) technology enables the building of virtual SoCs by connecting together a set of MoChi <span class="s2">TM </span>in a modular fashion to implement a final product. Both FLC<span class="s2">TM </span>and MoChi <span class="s2">TM </span>technologies may become integral parts of our product evolution in the future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our current product offerings are primarily in three broad end markets: storage, networking, and mobile and wireless. Our net revenue by end market for the last three fiscal years is as follows:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:5.30134pt"

Our sales force is strategically aligned along key customer lines in order to offer fully integrated platforms to our customers. In this way, we believe we can more effectively offer a broader set of content into our key customers’ end products, without having multiple product groups separately engage the same customer. We complement and support our direct sales force with manufacturers’ representatives for our products in North America, Europe and Asia. In addition, we have distributors who support our sales and marketing activities in the United States, Europe and Asia. We also use third-party logistics providers who maintain warehouses in close proximity to our customers’ facilities. We expect a significant percentage of our sales will continue to come from direct sales to key customers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We use field application engineers to provide technical support and assistance to existing and potential customers in designing, testing and qualifying systems designs that incorporate our products.

These lead times typically change based on the current capacity at the foundries. We often maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. In addition, increased use of “hubs” managed by third-party logistics providers has resulted in a higher number of inventory locations and higher overall inventory levels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We do not believe that backlog is a meaningful or reliable indicator for future demand, due to the following:</p><ul id="l3"><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">an industry practice that allows customers to cancel or change orders prior to the scheduled shipment dates;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">an increasing portion of our revenue comes from products shipped to customers using third-party logistics providers, or “hubs” wherein the product can be pulled at any time by the customer and is therefore never reflected in backlog; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">scheduled future shipments include shipments to distributors for which we do not recognize revenue until the products are sold to end customers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We believe that our future success depends on our ability to introduce improvements to our existing products and to develop new products that deliver cost- effective solutions for both existing and new markets. Our research and development efforts are directed largely to the development of high-performance analog, mixed- signal, digital signal processing and embedded microprocessor integrated circuits with the smallest die size and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">7</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lowest power. We devote a significant portion of our resources to expanding our product portfolio based on a broad intellectual property portfolio with designs that enable high-performance, reliable communications over a variety of physical transmission media. We are also focused on incorporating functions currently provided by stand-alone integrated circuits into our integrated platform solutions to reduce our customers’ overall system costs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We have assembled a core team of engineers who have extensive experience in the areas of mixed-signal circuit design, digital signal processing, embedded microprocessors, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (“CMOS”) technology and system-level architectures. We have invested and will continue to invest significant funds for research and development. Our research and development expense was $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing</h1><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Integrated Circuit Fabrication</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The vast majority of our integrated circuits are fabricated using widely available CMOS processes, which provide greater flexibility to engage independent foundries to manufacture integrated circuits at lower costs. By outsourcing manufacturing, we are able to avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility. This allows us to focus our efforts on the design and marketing of our products. We currently outsource a large percentage of our integrated circuit manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. We also utilize United Microelectronics Corporation, with the remaining manufacturing outsourced to other foundries primarily in Asia. We work closely with our foundry partners to forecast on a monthly basis our manufacturing capacity requirements. We closely monitor foundry production to ensure consistent overall quality, reliability and yield levels. Our integrated circuits are currently fabricated in several advanced manufacturing processes up to and including 28 nanometer. Because finer manufacturing processes lead to enhanced performance, smaller silicon chip size and lower power requirements, we continually evaluate the benefits and feasibility of migrating to smaller geometry process technology in order to reduce cost and improve performance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Assembly and Test</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We outsource all product packaging and testing requirements for our products in production to several assembly and test subcontractors primarily located in China, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Environmental Management</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We believe that our products comply with the current Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the European legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead, and the Regulation, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals SVHC Substances Directive. In addition, each of our manufacturing subcontractors complies with ISO 14001:2004, the international standard related to environmental management. We are also working to establish a “conflict-free” supply chain, including ethical sourcing of certain minerals for our products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intellectual Property</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our future revenue growth and overall success depend in large part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions, confidentiality agreements and licenses to protect our intellectual property. As of January 30, 2016, we have been issued and/or have acquired over 6,200 U.S. patents and over 1,700 foreign patents with expiration dates ranging from 2016 to 2036. We also have more than 5,200 U.S. and foreign pending patent applications on various aspects of our technology. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our patents and intellectual property, including the risk that our patents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">8</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">may be invalidated, the risk that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products and technology without authorization, and the risks involved with operating in foreign countries where the laws are not as protective of our intellectual property as in the United States.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We have expended and will continue to expend considerable resources in establishing a patent position designed to protect our intellectual property. While our ability to compete is enhanced by our ability to protect our intellectual property, we believe that in view of the rapid pace of technological change, the combination of the technical experience and innovative skills of our employees may be as important to our business as the legal protection of our patents and other proprietary information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">From time to time, we may desire or be required to renew or to obtain licenses from third parties in order to further develop and effectively market commercially viable products or in connection with a pending or future claim or action asserted against us. We cannot be sure that any necessary licenses will be available or will be available on commercially reasonable terms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The integrated circuit industry is characterized by vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in significant and often time consuming and expensive litigation. From time to time, we receive, and may continue to receive in the future, notices that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused the proprietary rights of other parties. For instance, we have had a dispute with Dr. Sehat Sutardja, our former Chief Executive Officer and a current member of our board of directors, related to his stated belief of ownership of certain patent rights related to the Final-Level Cache invention and his later assignment of associated patent applications to Marvell. Our Audit Committee investigated this claim and concluded that the FLC invention was owned by the Company.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">In addition, we have in the past and may in the future be sued by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets, or who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents. Although we defend these claims vigorously, it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits. Furthermore, we may need to engage in litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or the rights of our customers, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. All such litigation, even if not valid or successfully asserted, could result in significant costs and a diversion of management and personnel resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Competition has intensified as a result of the increasing demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometries, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors continue to strengthen their product offerings and new competitors enter our markets. In addition, we expect competitive pressure from our customers to increase as they may continue to increase the vertical nature of their business by developing their own</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in-house solutions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for our products depends on a number of factors, including the:</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">performance, features, quality and price of our products;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">timing and success of new product introductions by us, our customers and our competitors;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">emergence, and rate of adoption and acceptance of new industry standards;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 5pt;line-height: 188%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">number and nature of our competitors in a given market.

Although we believe we will be able to successfully compete with existing and potential competitors, some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that allow them to compete effectively against us. Our current or future competitors could also introduce products that are priced lower, provide superior performance or are based on new or emerging technologies. Furthermore, some of our customers have already developed, or in the future may develop, technologies that could compete directly with our products. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of competitive risks associated with our business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Historically, average unit selling prices in the integrated circuit industry in general, and for our products in particular, have decreased over the life of a particular product. We expect that the average unit selling prices of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures. In order to offset expected declines in the selling prices of our products, we will need to continue to introduce innovative new products and reduce the cost of our products. To accomplish this, we intend to continue to implement design changes that lower the cost of manufacturing, and assembling and testing our products. We may also enter into long-term, strategic arrangements with foundry partners to secure wafer capacity at reduced prices, by negotiating reduced charges from our foundries. Because we do not operate our own manufacturing, assembly or testing facilities, we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities.
