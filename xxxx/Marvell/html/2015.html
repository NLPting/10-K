Our core strength of expertise is the development of complex System-on-a-Chip (“SoC”) and System-in-a-Package (“SiP”) devices, leveraging our extensive technology portfolio of intellectual property in the areas of analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, and embedded and standalone integrated circuits. The majority of our product portfolio leverages the ARM technology portfolio. We also develop platforms that we define as integrated hardware along with software that incorporates digital computing technologies designed and configured to provide an optimized computing solution. Our broad product portfolio includes devices for data storage, enterprise-class Ethernet data switching, Ethernet physical- layer transceivers (“PHY”), mobile handsets, connectivity, Internet-of-Things (“IoT”) devices and other consumer electronics. We were incorporated in Bermuda in January 1995.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our registered and mailing address is Canon’s Court, 22 Victoria Street, Hamilton HM 12, Bermuda, and our telephone number there is (441) 296-6395. The address of our U.S. operating subsidiary is Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., 5488 Marvell Lane, Santa Clara, California 95054, and our telephone number there is</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(408) 222-2500. We also have operations in many countries, including Canada, China, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Taiwan. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. For example, the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 is referred to as fiscal 2015.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Available Information</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.marvell.com/" class="a" target="_blank">Our website address is located at </a>www.marvell.com. The information contained in our website does not form any part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, we make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file this material with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our Markets and Products</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Over the last several years, we have transitioned from a supplier of standalone semiconductor components to a supplier of fully integrated platform solutions. Our platform solutions contain multiple intellectual property components in integrated hardware along with software that incorporates digital, analog and mixed-signal computing and communication technologies, designed and configured to provide an optimized solution compared to individual components. Our solutions have become increasingly integrated, with more and more components resulting in an all-in-one solution for a given customer’s end product. The demand for such highly integrated platform solutions is generally driven by technological changes and anticipation of the future needs of device manufacturers and end users, as well as, to an increasing extent, service providers, including cellular network carriers and Internet based applications providers. For example, in order to provide a complete solution for a specific handheld consumer electronics device, a device manufacturer may require a solution that integrates a high-performance applications processor, along with seamless communications capability with a 3G/4G Long-Term Evolution (“LTE”) multi-band modem, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, radio frequency (“RF”), GPS and near field communication (“NFC”). In addition, a device manufacturer may require high-definition graphics processing, high-definition video and audio, and power management. These platforms will often cross multiple end markets, integrating components and technologies traditionally associated with one end market with components and technologies from another end market. For example, we may integrate an applications processor, traditionally associated with the mobile and wireless end market, with software and other components in an end user product targeting the home cloud. Therefore, it has become critical that our products across multiple end markets work together seamlessly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">3</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The integration of these various technologies onto a single piece of silicon is referred to as SoC. The development of SoC’s became increasingly popular over the past decade, particularly within end markets such as mobile. We believe the development of SoC’s will continue to be popular for various end devices in the years to come.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">In addition, software has become increasingly important to our business over the last several years and we expect software to become even more important in the years to come. On-chip software, which acts as the “driver” for the functionality of the chip, has always been a critical part of our business. However, the software that we deliver with our chip has become significantly more complex as the range of uses and the needs in application-level software have increased. For example, a chip that we develop for a smartphone may need to include software that is compatible with the latest version of a specific company’s operating system that enables 3D user interface and graphics, and that works seamlessly with a variety of popular end user applications. These demands require a significant amount of up-front software development, testing, and often, additional licensing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The market for consumer electronics devices is becoming increasingly standards-based. These standards change rapidly and often several different standards may exist and overlap in a single market. Our platforms are typically designed to operate seamlessly with all relevant standards, which require us to design products in anticipation of these relevant standards. For example, we have communications processors and software designed to operate on several different cellular standards, including GSM/enhanced data for the GSM environment (“EDGE”) (2G), WCDMA (3G), TD-SCDMA (China 3G) and 4G LTE.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our current product offerings are primarily in three broad end markets: mobile and wireless, storage, and networking. Our net revenue by end market for the last three fiscal years are as follows:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:5.30134pt"

These lead times typically change based on the current capacity at the foundries. We often maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. In addition, increased use of “hubs” managed by third-party logistics providers has resulted in a higher number of inventory locations and higher overall inventory levels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We do not believe that backlog is a meaningful or reliable indicator for future demand, due to the following:</p><ul id="l2"><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">an industry practice that allows customers to cancel or change orders prior to the scheduled shipment dates;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">an increasing portion of our revenue comes from products shipped to customers using third-party logistics providers, or “hubs” wherein the product can be pulled at any time by the customer and is therefore never reflected in backlog; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">scheduled future shipments include shipments to distributors for which we do not recognize revenue until the products are sold to end customers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We believe that our future success depends on our ability to introduce improvements to our existing products and to develop new products that deliver cost- effective solutions for both existing and new markets. Our research and development efforts are directed largely to the development of high-performance analog, mixed- signal, digital signal processing and embedded microprocessor integrated circuits with the smallest die size and lowest power. We devote a significant portion of our resources to expanding our product portfolio based on a broad intellectual property portfolio with designs that enable high-performance, reliable communications over a variety of physical transmission media. We are also focused on incorporating functions currently provided by stand alone integrated circuits into our integrated platform solutions to reduce our customers’ overall system costs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">7</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We have assembled a core team of engineers who have extensive experience in the areas of mixed-signal circuit design, digital signal processing, embedded microprocessors, CMOS technology and system-level architectures. We have invested and will continue to invest significant funds for research and development. Our research and development expense was $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing</h1><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Integrated Circuit Fabrication</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The vast majority of our integrated circuits are fabricated using widely available CMOS processes, which provide greater flexibility to engage independent foundries to manufacture integrated circuits at lower costs. By outsourcing manufacturing, we are able to avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility. This allows us to focus our efforts on the design and marketing of our products. We currently outsource a large percentage of our integrated circuit manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. We also utilize United Microelectronics Corporation, with the remaining manufacturing outsourced to other foundries primarily in Asia. We work closely with our foundry partners to forecast on a monthly basis our manufacturing capacity requirements. We closely monitor foundry production to ensure consistent overall quality, reliability and yield levels. Our integrated circuits are currently fabricated in several advanced manufacturing processes up to and including 28 nanometer. Because finer manufacturing processes lead to enhanced performance, smaller silicon chip size and lower power requirements, we continually evaluate the benefits and feasibility of migrating to smaller geometry process technology in order to reduce cost and improve performance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Assembly and Test</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We outsource all product packaging and testing requirements for our products in production to several assembly and test subcontractors, including STATS ChipPAC Ltd. in China, Korea and Singapore; Global Testing Corporation in Taiwan; Siliconware Precision Industries in China and Taiwan; and ASE Electronics in China, Singapore and Taiwan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Environmental Management</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We believe that our products are compliant with the current Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the European legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead, and the REACH (Regulation, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals) SVHC Substances Directive. In addition, each of our manufacturing subcontractors complies with ISO 14001:2004, the international standard related to environmental management. We are also working to establish a “conflict-free” supply chain, including ethical sourcing of certain minerals for our products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intellectual Property</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our future revenue growth and overall success depend in large part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions, confidentiality agreements and licenses to protect our intellectual property. As of January 31, 2015, we have been issued and/or have acquired over 5,300 U.S. patents and over 1,400 foreign patents with expiration dates ranging from 2015 to 2035. We also have more than 3,800 U.S. and foreign pending patent applications on various aspects of our technology. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Report for a discussion of the risks associated with our patents and intellectual property, including the risk that our patents may be invalidated, the risk that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products and technology without authorization, and the risks involved with operating in foreign countries where the laws are not as protective of our intellectual property as in the United States. We have expended and will continue to expend considerable resources in establishing a patent position designed to protect our intellectual property. While our ability to compete is</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">8</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">enhanced by our ability to protect our intellectual property, we believe that in view of the rapid pace of technological change, the combination of the technical experience and innovative skills of our employees may be as important to our business as the legal protection of our patents and other proprietary information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">From time to time, we may desire or be required to renew or to obtain licenses from third parties in order to further develop and effectively market commercially viable products or in connection with a pending or future claim or action asserted against us. We cannot be sure that any necessary licenses will be available or will be available on commercially reasonable terms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The integrated circuit industry is characterized by vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in significant and often time consuming and expensive litigation. From time to time, we receive, and may continue to receive in the future, notices that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused the proprietary rights of other parties. In addition, we may be sued in the future by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets, or who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents. Although we defend these claims vigorously, it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits. Furthermore, we may need to engage in litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or the rights of our customers, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. All such litigation, even if not valid or successfully asserted, could result in significant costs and a diversion of management and personnel resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In order to offset expected declines in the selling prices of our products, we will need to continue to introduce innovative new products and reduce the cost of our products. To accomplish this, we intend to continue to implement design changes that lower the cost of manufacturing, and assembling and testing our products. We may also enter into long-term, strategic arrangements with foundry partners to secure wafer capacity at reduced prices, by negotiating reduced charges from our foundries. In addition, we plan to work with multiple foundry partners to ensure that our products are qualified and can be manufactured in multiple locations, which we believe will ensure favorable wafer pricing. Because we do not operate our own manufacturing, assembly or testing facilities, we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Report for further discussion of pricing risks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of January 31, 2015, we had a total of 7,163 employees.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Executive Officers of the Registrant</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following table shows information about our executive officers as of March 19, 2015:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:5.30134pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:8pt"><td style="width:131pt"><p class="s2" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;">Name</p></td><td style="width:90pt"><p class="s2" style="padding-right: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: right;">Age</p></td><td style="width:307pt"><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;">Position(s)</p></td></tr><tr style="height:10pt"><td style="width:131pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Dr. Sehat Sutardja</p></td><td style="width:90pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="padding-right: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: right;">53</p></td><td style="width:307pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board</p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:131pt"><p class="s3" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Weili Dai</p></td><td style="width:90pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-right: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: right;">53</p></td><td style="width:307pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">President and Director</p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:131pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Michael Rashkin</p></td><td style="width:90pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="padding-right: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: right;">70</p></td><td style="width:307pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Chief Financial Officer</p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:131pt"><p class="s3" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Dr. Zining Wu</p></td><td style="width:90pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-right: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: right;">43</p></td><td style="width:307pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Chief Technology Officer</p></td></tr></table><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Dr. Sehat Sutardja<span class="p">, one of our co-founders, has served as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors since 1995 (from 1995 to 2003 he was Co-Chairman of the Board of Directors).
