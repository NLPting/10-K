The cellular handset industry is our largest market and is characterized by large unit volumes, significant product mix shift, high technical barriers to entry and relatively short product lifecycles.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The cellular market is rapidly transitioning to smartphones and tablets based on LTE 4G interface standards to address the ever growing demand for always-on, anywhere connectivity. This demand has accelerated the deployment of advanced 4G networks in developed markets around the world. In addition, many carriers are constantly seeking to improve the speeds of their 4G networks with additional features such as carrier aggregation, while 3G service continues to expand in some global wireless markets outside of North America, Europe, China and Japan. While entry level 2G- and 3G-only handsets are still shipping in significant volumes, these market segments are decreasing as a percentage of total handsets shipped and represent a smaller opportunity in terms of RF dollar content per phone. Internet access, email, social media and the demand for mobile video are driving the demand for smartphones, tablets and other mobile data devices. These devices often contain two to five times more RF content than basic or feature phones. They support multiple air interface standards, require multiple frequency bands for broad geographic coverage, often operate simultaneously with WiFi and Bluetooth and must meet higher performance specifications. For example, 4G smartphones typically have two to three times as many bands as a 3G phone while the RF front end occupies substantially the same area in both phones. With smartphones growing faster than the overall handset market and containing more RF content, we expect our addressable market to grow faster than the overall handset market.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">5</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_002.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things is also driving the growth in demand for RF content for “Machine Type Communications” or “MTC” as entirely new classes of devices, including systems for connected homes, energy management systems and a variety of health, fitness and medical devices, are enabled with wireless connectivity to transmit data obtained from embedded sensors, meters, controllers and other components. As part of this phenomena, machine-to-machine (“M2M”) devices are increasingly integrating WiFi and cellular content for a growing number of applications, including automotive, electric and water utilities, fleet management and point-of-sale.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In cellular infrastructure, network operators are rapidly building out their 4G LTE networks to handle more data traffic, which increases the requirements for more and faster wireless backhaul systems, including upgrading transport capacity through microwave PtP radio and optical network links. In addition, to increase network coverage and capacity and ease the strain from skyrocketing mobile data traffic on congested cellular networks, the cellular infrastructure market is turning to WiFi offload strategies, including public access WiFi hotspots, and utilizing new architectures with small cell base stations such as micro cells, pico cells, and femtocells. The RF content in premises-based devices and distribution networks is increasing due to higher capacity requirements achieved through enabling increased bandwidth capability, typically at higher frequencies of operation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In our CATV and optical network wireline transport markets, the rapid explosion of consumer and business data transmission, whether from high definition television (“HDTV”), Internet protocol television (“IPTV”), and voice over Internet protocol (“VoIP”), as well as the associated increases in Internet traffic in data centers, are driving market growth and placing increased emphasis on product performance, integration and power consumption.

Smartphones typically have power amplifiers, filtering, switches and antenna control solutions for voice and data communications. Additionally, they typically work across multiple standards and frequency bands enabling multi-region access and coverage. The expanding number of RF bands has increased the overall dollar content in an average smartphone by two to five times compared to a traditional voice- only phone. The increase in wireless communication traffic has resulted in congestion of the assigned frequency bands, creating capacity issues for network operators. In today’s cellular industry, operators routinely spend billions of dollars on new spectrum, which creates significant pressure to deploy handsets that can take advantage of the increased capacity. As a consequence, wireless communications standards are evolving and new technologies are being deployed to utilize the available spectrum more efficiently. This in turn tends to increase the complexity of filtering requirements in each device. Mobile devices of this complexity provide new technical challenges that our products are well suited to address, and we believe our mobile device strategy will meet the needs of this evolving market.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We sell multiple components and solutions for mobile phones.

These prime contractors and subcontractors use our die-level integrated circuits and discrete components, MMICs and multi-chip modules for radar, electronic warfare and communications systems. These programs include major shipboard, airborne and battlefield radar systems as well as communications and electronic warfare applications. Our products are used in large-scale programs with long lead-times. Once a component has been designed into an end-use product for a military application, the same component is generally used during the entire production life of the end-use product.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our products utilized in radars are bringing new capabilities to detect and neutralize threats against aircrews, shipboard and infantry defense forces around the globe. We are actively engaged with existing customers while seeking greater emerging application opportunities. For example, our legacy of phased array radar experience with domestic airborne fighter platforms has led to ongoing work in the multi-national next generation platforms. In addition, we expect our products to be used in retrofits that upgrade the radars and other systems for the existing domestic fleet of fighter aircraft.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The capability to track multiple targets simultaneously is one of the key enhancements found in the new generation of fighters. We are teamed with contractors in new programs to bring this type of capability to the warfighter and we also are engaged in retrofits of other tactical fighter jet programs. Our microwave PAs provide the capability to transmit the power that is at the heart of phased array radar operation. These radars consist of large element arrays composed of many individual integrated circuits. In addition to supplying components for airborne and ground-based phased array radars, we are engaged with prime defense contractors in the continuing development and production of radars for shipboard applications.

Our products have varying degrees of complexity and rely on semiconductors and other components that are manufactured in-house or outsourced. The majority of our products are multi-chip modules utilizing multiple semiconductor process technologies. We are a leading supplier of RF solutions and a leading manufacturer of compound semiconductors, including GaAs HBT, GaAs pHEMT, GaN, SAW, TC-SAW and BAW for RF applications.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We operate wafer fabrication facilities for the production of GaAs, GaN, SAW, TC-SAW and BAW wafers in Greensboro, North Carolina; Hillsboro, Oregon; Richardson, Texas; Apopka, Florida; and Bend, Oregon. We also</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">10</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_007.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">use multiple silicon-based process technologies, including SOI and CMOS, in our products. We outsource all silicon manufacturing to leading silicon foundries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have our own copper bumping and WLP technologies and also use external suppliers for these technologies. In packages that employ bumped die, the electrical connections are created directly on the surface of the die, which eliminates wirebonds so that the die may be attached directly to a substrate or leadframe. This type of technology provides a higher density interconnection capability than wirebonded die and enables smaller and thinner form factors. We use WLP technologies for our SAW, TC-SAW and BAW products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once the semiconductor manufacturing is complete, the wafers are singulated, or separated, into individual units called die. For the majority of our products, the next step in our manufacturing process is assembly. During assembly, the die and other necessary components are placed on a high density interconnect substrate to provide connectivity between the die and the components. This populated substrate is formed into a microelectronic package. Once assembled, the products are tested for RF performance and prepared for shipment through a tape and reel process. To assemble and test our products, we primarily use internal assembly facilities in the United States, China, Costa Rica and Germany, and we also utilize several external suppliers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fabrication of ICs and filter products in these facilities is highly complex and sensitive to particles and other contaminants, and requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minute impurities, difficulties in the fabrication process or defects in the masks used to transfer circuits onto the wafers can cause a substantial percentage of the wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional. The more brittle nature of GaAs wafers can also lead to more wafer breakages than experienced with silicon wafers. To maximize wafer yield and quality, we test our products in various stages in the fabrication process, maintain continuous reliability monitoring and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow. Our manufacturing yields vary significantly among our products, depending upon a given product’s complexity and our manufacturing experience.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We incur a high level of fixed costs to operate our own manufacturing facilities. These fixed costs consist primarily of facility occupancy costs, repair, maintenance and depreciation costs related to manufacturing equipment and fixed labor costs related to manufacturing and process engineering.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our quality management system is registered to ISO 9001 standards and our environmental management system is registered to ISO 14001:2004. This means that a third- party independent auditor has determined that these systems meet the requirements developed by the International Organization of Standardization, a non-governmental network of the national standards institutes of over 150 countries. The ISO 9001 standards provide models for quality assurance in design/development, production, installation and servicing. The ISO 14001:2004 standards provide a structure within which a company can develop or strengthen its quality system for managing its environmental affairs. We believe that all of our key vendors and suppliers are compliant with applicable ISO 9001 and/or TS-16949 standards, which means that their operations have in each case been determined by auditors to comply with certain internationally developed quality control standards. We qualify and monitor assembly contractors based on cost and quality.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our manufacturing facilities in Greensboro, North Carolina; Hillsboro, Oregon; Richardson, Texas; and Apopka, Florida are certified to ISO/TS 16949 standards, which is the highest international quality standard for the automotive industry and incorporates ISO technical specifications that are more stringent than ISO 9001 quality management systems requirements. The ISO/TS 16949 standard combines North American and European automotive requirements and serves the global automotive market.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Raw Materials</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We purchase numerous raw materials, passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing processes. We use independent foundries to supply all of our silicon-based integrated circuits. High demand for SOI wafers to support manufacture of our switch products has led to supply constraints in the past, which we are addressing by qualifying new silicon foundries and securing supply commitments from existing silicon suppliers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For our acoustic filter manufacturing operations, we use several raw materials, including wafers made from quartz, silicon, lithium niobate (“LiNbO3”) or lithium tantalite (“LiTaO3”), as well as ceramic or metal packages.

Our most significant suppliers of ceramic surface mount packages are based in Japan. For our SAW operations, we also utilize multiple qualified wafer and mask set vendors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our manufacturing strategy includes a balance of internal and external sites (primarily for assembly operations), which helps reduce costs, provides flexibility of supply, and minimizes the risk of supply disruption. We routinely qualify multiple sources of supply and manufacturing sites to reduce the risk of supply interruptions or price increases and closely monitor suppliers’ key performance indicators. Our suppliers&#39; and our manufacturing sites are geographically diversified (with our largest volume sources distributed throughout Southern and Eastern Asia), and we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials, passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing needs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Customers</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We design, develop, manufacture and market our products to leading U.S. and international OEMs and ODMs. We are also engaged with leading baseband reference design partners located primarily in the U.S. and China.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some of our MP customers use multiple contract manufacturers for product assembly and test.

Additionally, many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do, which may allow them to implement new technologies and develop new products more quickly than we can.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">13</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_010.png"/></span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intellectual Property</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We believe our intellectual property, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, is important to our business and we actively seek opportunities to leverage our intellectual property portfolio to promote our business interests. Moreover, we respect the intellectual property rights of others and have implemented policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of infringing or misappropriating third party intellectual property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patent applications are filed within the U.S. and in other countries where we have a market presence. On occasion, some applications do not mature into patents for various reasons, including rejections based on prior art. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as</p><ol id="l2"><ol id="l3"><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">laws. We have approximately 1,000 patents that expire from 2015 to 2035. We also continue to acquire patents through acquisitions or direct prosecution efforts and engage in licensing transactions to secure the right to practice third parties’ patents. In view of the relatively short market life of many of our products, we believe the duration and scope of our most relevant patents are sufficient to support our business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We periodically register federal trademarks, service marks and trade names that distinguish our product brand names in the market. We also monitor these marks for their proper and intended use.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We also rely on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our interest in confidential and proprietary information, including business strategies, unpatented inventions, designs and process technology. Such information is closely monitored and made available only to those employees whose responsibilities require access to the information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our sales are the result of standard purchase orders or specific agreements with customers. We maintain Qorvo-owned finished goods inventory at certain customers’ “hub” locations and do not recognize revenue until our customers draw down the inventory at these hubs. Our customers’ projections of consumption of hub inventory and quantities on purchase orders, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently revised within agreed-upon lead times to reflect changes in the customers’ needs. Because industry practice allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment, and with little or no penalty, we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On March 28, 2015, we had approximately 6,700 employees. We believe that our future prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain skilled employees. Competition for skilled personnel is intense, and the number of persons with relevant experience, particularly in RF engineering, product design and technical marketing, is limited. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. A number of our European-based employees (less than 5% of our global workforce as of March 28, 2015) are subject to collective bargaining-type arrangements. We have never experienced any work stoppage and we believe that our current employee relations are good.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table

We provide our own manufacturing waste water treatment and disposal for most of our manufacturing facilities and have contracted for the disposal of hazardous waste. State agencies require us to report usage of environmentally hazardous materials and we have retained appropriate personnel to help ensure compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. We believe that costs arising from existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are an ISO 14001:2004 certified manufacturer with a comprehensive Environmental Management System (“EMS”) in place in order to help ensure control of the environmental aspects of the manufacturing process. Our EMS mandates compliance and establishes appropriate checks and balances to minimize the potential for non- compliance with environmental laws and regulations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We actively monitor the hazardous materials that are used in the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products, particularly materials that are retained in the final product. We have developed specific restrictions on the content of certain hazardous materials in our products, as well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and subcontractors. This helps to ensure that our products are compliant with the requirements of the markets into which the products will be sold. For example, our products are compliant with the European Union RoHS Directive (2011/65/EU on the Restriction of Use of Hazardous Substances), which prohibits the sale in the European Union market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing certain families of substances above a specified threshold.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We do not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for the remainder of fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2017.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Access to Public Information</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We make available, free of charge through our website (http://www.qorvo.com), our annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q (including related filings in XBRL format) and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &quot;Exchange Act&quot;) as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these reports with, or furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Our markets are characterized by the frequent introduction of new products in response to evolving product and process technologies and consumer demand for greater functionality, lower costs, smaller products and better performance. As a result, we have experienced and will continue to experience some product design obsolescence. We expect our customers&#39; demands for reductions in cost and improvements in product performance to continue, which means that we must continue to improve our product designs and develop new products that may use new technologies. It is possible that competing technologies will emerge that permit the manufacture of products that are equivalent or acceptable in terms of performance, but lower in cost, to the products we make under existing processes. If we cannot design products using competitive technologies or develop competitive products, our operating results will be adversely affected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">16</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_014.png"/></span></p></body></html>
