These and other risks and uncertainties, which are described in more detail under Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other reports and statements that we file with the SEC, could cause actual results and developments to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any of these forward-looking statements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our audited consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">OVERVIEW</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Company</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On February 22, 2014, RFMD and TriQuint entered into the Merger Agreement, which provided for the combination of RFMD and TriQuint in a merger of equals and resulted in the Business Combination under a new holding company named Qorvo, Inc. The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were consummated on January 1, 2015, and as a result, TriQuint&#39;s results of operations are included in Qorvo&#39;s fiscal 2015 Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period of January 1, 2015 through March 28, 2015 (the &quot;Post-Combination Period&quot;) and for the full fiscal years of 2017 and 2016.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For financial reporting and accounting purposes, RFMD was the acquirer of TriQuint in the Business Combination. Unless otherwise noted, “we,” “our” or &quot;us” in this report refers to RFMD and its subsidiaries prior to the closing of the Business Combination and to Qorvo and its subsidiaries after the closing of the Business Combination.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Qorvo® is a product and technology leader at the forefront of the growing global demand for always-on broadband connectivity.

These business segments are based on the organizational structure and information reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker (&quot;CODM&quot;), and are managed separately based on the end markets and applications they support. The CODM allocates resources and evaluates the performance of each operating segment primarily based on operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue. For financial information about the results of our operating segments for each of the last three fiscal years, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fiscal 2017 Management Summary</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l3"><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Our revenue increased 16.2% in fiscal 2017 to $3,032.6 million compared to $2,610.7 million in fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher demand for our cellular RF solutions in support of marquee smartphones and customers based in China and higher sales of our wireless infrastructure, defense and aerospace and WiFi products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Our gross margin for fiscal 2017 was 37.4% compared to 40.2% for fiscal 2016. Gross margin was adversely impacted in fiscal 2017 by an unfavorable change in product mix towards lower margin low-band power amplifier + duplexer (&quot;PAD&quot;) modules, product cost reductions lagging normal average selling price erosion, lower factory utilization and unfavorable inventory adjustments primarily due to lower than expected manufacturing and assembly yields on the low- band PAD modules in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. These adverse factors were partially offset by lower intangible amortization, stock-based compensation and other costs related to the Business Combination.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">34</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017-2/Image_002.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Our operating income was $88.1 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $12.0 million in fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher gross profit from higher revenue and lower intangible amortization, stock-based compensation and other costs related to the Business Combination in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Our net loss per diluted share was$0.13 for fiscal 2017 as compared to net loss per diluted share of$0.20 for fiscal 2016.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">We generated positive cash flow from operations of $776.8 million for fiscal 2017 as compared to $687.9 million for fiscal 2016. This year-over-year increase was due primarily to improvement in working capital, partially offset by lower adjustments for non-cash items.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Capital expenditures totaled $552.7 million in fiscal 2017, as compared to $315.6 million in fiscal 2016, with the increase primarily related to projects for increasing premium filter capacity and manufacturing cost savings initiatives.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">During fiscal 2017, we recorded interest expense of$69.9 million (which was offset by $13.6 million of capitalized interest) on the $1.0 billion of senior notes that were issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Interest paid on these notes in fiscal 2017 was $71.2 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">During fiscal 2017, we repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately$209.4 million, as compared to 24.3 million shares of our common stock for approximately $1,300.0 million during fiscal 2016.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">During fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, we recorded integration and restructuring expenses related to the Business Combination of$18.9 million and $36.6 million, respectively. We expect these costs will continue to decline in future years.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent:

Gross margin was adversely impacted in fiscal 2017 by an unfavorable change in product mix towards lower margin low-band PAD modules, product cost reductions lagging normal average selling price erosion, lower factory utilization and unfavorable inventory adjustments primarily due to lower than expected manufacturing and assembly yields on the low-band PAD modules in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The lower yield was associated with the device packaging, not device functionality; however the impact was significant because the issue was identified late in the production process. These adverse factors were partially offset by lower intangible amortization, stock-based compensation and other costs related to the Business Combination in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our overall gross margin for fiscal2016 was 40.2% as compared to 40.3% in fiscal 2015. This slight decrease was primarily due to higher cash and non-cash expenses related to the Business Combination (including intangible amortization and stock-based compensation) and average selling price erosion. This decrease was offset by increased revenue and profitability resulting from the addition of TriQuint&#39;s operations as well as the synergies created from the Business Combination, a favorable change in product mix towards higher margin products and manufacturing and sourcing-related cost reductions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Operating Expenses</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In fiscal 2017, R&amp;D spending increased $22.1 million, or 4.9%, as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily driven by costs associated with the design and development of high-performance filter based products and GaN-based technologies and products.

The Business Combination adjustment related to a deferred tax asset that was recorded during fiscal 2015 in the initial purchase price accounting with a full valuation allowance, but which deferred tax asset was determined in fiscal 2016 to not exist as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, in fiscal 2016, that deferred tax asset was removed along with the offsetting deferred tax asset valuation allowance. At the end of fiscal 2016, a $5.2 million valuation allowance remained against foreign net deferred tax assets and a $29.5 million valuation allowance remained against domestic deferred tax assets as management has determined it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized, effectively increasing the domestic net deferred tax liabilities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During fiscal 2016, North Carolina enacted legislation to reduce the corporate income tax rate from5% to 4% and phase-in over a three-year period a single sales factor apportionment methodology. In addition, the Company underwent operational changes to leverage existing resources and capabilities of its Singapore subsidiary and consolidate operations and responsibilities associated with its foreign manufacturing operations and foreign customers in that Singapore subsidiary. Together these changes resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of future taxable income expected to be allocated to North Carolina and other states in which the Company&#39;s net operating loss and credit carryovers exist. As a result, it was no longer more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to those state net operating loss and credit carryovers for which a valuation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">39</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017-2/Image_007.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">allowance is being provided will be realized before they expire.

The decrease was comprised of $135.7 million for domestic deferred tax assets for which realization was determined to be more likely than not with the increase in domestic deferred tax liabilities related to domestic amortizable intangible assets arising in connection with the Business Combination and other changes in the net deferred tax assets for foreign subsidiaries during the fiscal year, offset by an increase of $6.2 million related to deferred tax assets acquired in the Business Combination which are not more likely than not of being realized. At the end of fiscal 2015, a $0.2 million valuation allowance remained against foreign net deferred tax assets and a$13.6 million valuation allowance remained against domestic deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized, effectively increasing the domestic net deferred tax liabilities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of April 1, 2017, we had federal loss carryovers of approximately$202.6 million that expire in fiscal years 2020 to 2036 if unused and state losses of approximately</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$209.3 million that expire in fiscal years 2018 to 2036 if unused. Federal research credits of $104.8 million, federal foreign tax credits of $5.0 million, and state credits of $57.4 million may expire in fiscal years 2018 to 2037, 2018 to 2027, and 2018 to 2032, respectively. Federal alternative minimum tax credits of $3.2 million carry forward indefinitely. Foreign losses in China of approximately $3.3 million and in the Netherlands of approximately $55.4 million expire in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal years 2018 to 2026, respectively. Included in the amounts above are certain net operating losses and other tax attribute assets acquired in conjunction with the GreenPeak acquisition during the current fiscal year and acquisitions of Sirenza Microdevices, Inc.; Silicon Wave, Inc.; Amalfi Semiconductor Inc.; and the Business Combination in prior years. The utilization of these acquired domestic tax assets is subject to certain annual limitations as required under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state income tax provisions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled$90.6 million as of April 1, 2017, $69.1 million as of April 2, 2016, and $59.4 million as of March 28, 2015. Of these amounts, $84.4 million (net of federal benefit of state taxes), $64.2 million (net of federal benefit of state taxes), and $55.0 million (net of federal benefit of state taxes) as of April 1, 2017, April 2, 2016, and March 28, 2015, respectively, represent the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in each of the fiscal years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. During fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $2.1 million, $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled $7.1 million, $5.0 million and $3.4 million as of April 1, 2017, April 2, 2016 and March 28, 2015, respectively. Within the next 12 months, we believe it is reasonably possible that only a minimal amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced as a result of reductions for tax positions taken in prior years where the only uncertainty was related to the timing of the tax deduction.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (&quot;FASB&quot;) ASC 718,<i>“Compensation – Stock Compensation,” </i>stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award using an option pricing model for stock options (Black-Scholes) and market price for restricted stock units, and is recognized as expense over the employee&#39;s requisite service period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of April 1, 2017, total remaining unearned compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units and options was$70.5 million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of approximately 1.2 years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">40</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017-2/Image_008.png"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity.

This year-over-year increase was due primarily to improvement in working capital, partially offset by lower adjustments for non-cash items.

This increase was primarily due to the Business Combination in fiscal 2015 that accounted for an increase in cash provided by investing activities of approximately$224.3 million. Additionally, there were higher capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, primarily related to projects for increasing premium filter capacity and manufacturing cost savings initiatives, partially offset by increased proceeds from higher net proceeds from available-for-sale securities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cash Flows from Financing Activities</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 was $165.6 million, compared to $282.9 million in fiscal 2016.

This increase was primarily due to the repurchase of 24.3 million shares of our common stock for approximately$1,300.0 million, partially offset by the net proceeds from the issuance of our Notes of approximately$987.8 million. During fiscal 2015, the remaining $87.5 million principal balance of our 1.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2014 was paid with cash on hand.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our future capital requirements may differ materially from those currently anticipated and will depend on many factors, including market acceptance of and demand for our products, acquisition opportunities, technological advances and our relationships with suppliers and customers.

However, if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products, or in the event that growth is faster than we had anticipated, operating cash flows may be insufficient to meet our needs. If existing resources and cash from operations are not sufficient to meet our future requirements or if we perceive conditions to be favorable, we may seek additional debt or equity financing. We cannot be sure that any additional equity or debt financing will not be dilutive to holders of our common stock.

The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of November 19, 2015 (the “Indenture”), by and among the Company, our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our revolving credit facility, as guarantors (the “Guarantors”), and MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as trustee. Interest is payable on the 2023 Notes at a rate of 6.75% per annum and on the 2025 Notes at a rate of 7.00% per annum.

The remaining terms of these operating leases range from less than one year to 11 years. Several of these leases have renewal options of up to two, ten-year periods and several also include standard inflation escalation terms. Several of these leases also include rent escalation, rent holidays and leasehold improvement incentives, which are recognized to expense on a straight- line basis. The amortization period of leasehold improvements made either at the inception of the lease or during the lease term is amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of the lease term (including renewals that are reasonably assured) or the useful life of the asset. We also lease various machinery and equipment and office equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. The remaining terms of these operating leases range from less than one year to approximately three years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Purchase Obligations</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our purchase obligations, totaling approximately $215.8 million, are primarily for the purchase of raw materials and manufacturing services that are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet because we had not received the related goods or services as of April 1, 2017.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cross-Licensing Liability</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The cross-licensing liability represents payables under a cross-licensing agreement and are included in &quot;Accrued liabilities&quot; and &quot;Other long-term liabilities&quot; in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of April 1, 2017.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Deferred Compensation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Commitments for deferred compensation represents the liability under our Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the &quot;NDCP&quot;). The NDCP provides eligible employees and members of the Board of Directors with the opportunity to defer a specified percentage of their cash compensation. The deferred earnings are invested at the discretion of each participating employee or director and the deferred compensation we are obligated to deliver is adjusted for increases or decreases in the deferred amount due to such investment. The current portion and non-current portion of the deferred compensation obligation is included in &quot;Accrued liabilities&quot; and &quot;Other long-term liabilities&quot; in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other Contractual Obligations</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of April 1, 2017, in addition to the amounts shown in the Contractual Obligations table above, we had$97.7 million of unrecognized income tax benefits and accrued interest, of which $16.6 million had been recorded as a liability. We are uncertain as to if, or when, such amounts may be settled.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As discussed in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, we have two pension plans in Germany with a combined benefit obligation of approximately $11.4 million as of April 1, 2017. Pension benefit payments are not included in the schedule above as they are not available for all periods presented. Pension benefit payments were less than $0.2 million in fiscal 2017 and are expected to be similar in fiscal2018.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Credit Agreement</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On April 7, 2015, we and our Guarantors entered into a five-year unsecured senior credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”), swing line lender, and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">44</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017-2/Image_013.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">L/C issuer, and a syndicate of lenders (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement includes a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, which includes a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swing line loans. We may request, at any time and from time to time, that the revolving credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed $150.0 million. The revolving credit facility is available to finance working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by the Guarantors. As of April 1, 2017, we have no outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At our option, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at (i) the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (ii) the Applicable Rate plus a rate equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the prime rate of the Administrative Agent, or (c) the Eurodollar Base Rate plus 1.0% (the “Base Rate”). All swing line loans will bear interest at a rate equal to the Applicable Rate plus the Base Rate. The Eurodollar Base Rate is the rate per annum equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, as published by Bloomberg, for dollar deposits for interest periods of one, two, three or six months, as selected by us. The Applicable Rate for Eurodollar Rate loans ranges from 1.50% per annum to 2.00% per annum. The Applicable Rate for Base Rate loans ranges from 0.50% per annum to 1.00% per annum. Interest for Eurodollar Rate loans will be payable at the end of each applicable interest period or at three- month intervals, if such interest period exceeds three months. Interest for Base Rate loans will be payable quarterly in arrears. We will pay a letter of credit fee equal to the Applicable Rate multiplied by the daily amount available to be drawn under any letter of credit, a fronting fee, and any customary documentary and processing charges for any letter of credit issued under the Credit Agreement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Credit Agreement contains various conditions, covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds and to avoid an event of default, including financial covenants that we must maintain. On November 12, 2015, the Credit Agreement was amended to increase the size of certain of the negative covenant baskets and the threshold for certain negative covenant incurrence-based permissions and to raise the consolidated leverage ratio test from 2.50 to 1.00 to 3.00 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. We must also maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. As of April 1, 2017, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, and the occurrence of an event of default will increase the applicable rate of interest by2.00% and could result in the termination of commitments under the revolving credit facility, the declaration that all outstanding loans are due and payable in whole or in part and the requirement of cash collateral deposits in respect of outstanding letters of credit. Outstanding amounts are due in full on the maturity date of April 7, 2020 (with amounts borrowed under the swing line option due in full no later than ten business days after such loan is made).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to use judgment and estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management. Our critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies; however, these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective (see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Inventory Reserves. <span class="p">The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons, generally 12 to 24 months. The estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory reserves are the same as those used in our revenue forecasts and are also consistent with the estimates used in our manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, market conditions, and customer acceptance of our products and technologies, as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">45</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017-2/Image_014.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Historically, inventory reserves have fluctuated as new technologies have been introduced and customers’ demand has shifted. Inventory reserves had an impact on margins of less than 2% in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Revenue Recognition. <span class="p">Net revenue is generated principally from sales of semiconductor products. We recognize revenue from product sales when the fundamental criteria are met, such as the time at which the title and risk and rewards of product ownership are transferred to the customer, price and terms are fixed or determinable, no significant vendor obligation exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales of products are generally made through either our sales force, manufacturers&#39; representatives or through a distribution network. Revenue from the majority of our products is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer from a Company-owned or third-party location. Some revenue is recognized upon receipt of the shipment by the customer. We have limited rebate programs offering price protection to certain distributors. These rebates represent approximately 7% of net revenue in fiscal 2017 and can be reasonably estimated based on specific criteria included in the rebate agreements and other known factors at the time. We reduce revenue and record reserves for product returns and allowances for price protection, stock rotation, and scrap allowance based on historical experience or specific identification depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We also recognize a portion of our net revenue through other agreements such as non-recurring engineering fees, contracts for R&amp;D work, royalty income, intellectual property (&quot;IP&quot;) revenue, and service revenue. These agreements are collectively less than 1% of consolidated revenue on an annual basis. Revenue from these agreements is recognized when the service is completed or upon certain milestones, as provided for in the agreements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Revenue from certain contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the costs incurred to date and the total contract amount, plus the contractual fee. If these contracts experience cost overruns, the percentage of completion method is used to determine revenue recognition. Revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized when the required deliverable is satisfied.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Royalty income is recognized based on a percentage of sales of the relevant product reported by licensees during the period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, we license or sell our rights to use portions of our IP portfolio, which includes certain patent rights useful in the manufacture and sales of certain products. IP revenue recognition is dependent on the terms of each agreement. We will recognize IP revenue (i) upon delivery of the IP and (ii) if we have no substantive future obligation to perform under the arrangement. We will defer recognition of IP revenue where future performance obligations are required to earn the revenue or the revenue is not guaranteed. Revenue from services is recognized during the period that the service is performed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Accounts receivable are recorded for all revenue items listed above and do not bear interest. We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations subsequent to the original sale, we will record an allowance against amounts due, and thereby reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due, industry and geographic concentrations, the current business environment and our historical experience.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our terms and conditions do not give our customers a right of return associated with the original sale of our products. However, we will authorize sales returns under certain circumstances, which include perceived quality problems, courtesy returns and like-kind exchanges. We evaluate our estimate of returns by analyzing all types of returns and the timing of such returns in relation to the original sale. Reserves are adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated returns versus the original sale of product.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Goodwill and Intangible Assets. <span class="p">Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for a business exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Intangibles are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license. The value of our intangibles, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) any future declines in our</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">46</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017-2/Image_015.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">operating results; (ii) a decline in the value of technology company stocks, including the value of our common stock; (iii) a prolonged or more significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the semiconductor industry; or (iv) failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We account for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the FASB&#39;s guidance, which requires annual testing for impairment or whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. We perform our annual impairment tests on the first day of the fourth quarter in each fiscal year. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of in-process research and development (&quot;IPRD&quot;).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment (commonly referred to as &quot;step zero&quot;) to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets is necessary. In performing step zero for our impairment test, we are required to make assumptions and judgments including the following: the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business; industry and market trends; and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate. We also consider recent fair value calculations of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and reporting units as well as cost factors such as changes in raw materials, labor or other costs. If the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived asset is less than its respective carrying value including goodwill, then we would perform an additional quantitative analysis. For goodwill, this involves a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit, including its goodwill, to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the second step of the process is performed to determine the amount of impairment. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit&#39;s goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount the carrying value of the reporting unit&#39;s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For indefinite-lived intangible assets, the quantitative analysis compares the carrying value of the asset to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount its carrying value exceeds its fair value. Determining the fair value of reporting units, indefinite-lived intangible assets and implied fair value of a reporting unit&#39;s goodwill is reliant upon estimated future revenues, profitability and cash flows and consideration of market factors. Assumptions, judgments and estimates are complex, subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Goodwill</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the expected benefit from the synergies of the business combinations generating the underlying goodwill. For fiscal 2017, we performed a qualitative assessment of the fair value of our reporting units and as a result of our analysis, we determined that there were no indicators of impairment and no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For fiscal 2016, although there were no indicators of impairment, we opted to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded to perform fair value assessments of our reporting units (the first step of the quantitative impairment analysis) as the fair value of the reporting units had changed (due to the Business Combination) since the last time we performed a quantitative analysis. The quantitative assessments performed reaffirmed that there were no indicators of impairment for fiscal 2016.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In performing these quantitative assessments, consistent with our historical approach, we used both the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The income approach involves discounting future estimated cash flows. The sum of the reporting unit cash flow projections was compared to our market capitalization in a discounted cash flow framework to calculate an overall implied internal rate of return (or discount rate) for the Company. Our market capitalization was adjusted to a control basis assuming a reasonable control premium, which resulted in an implied</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">47</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017-2/Image_016.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">discount rate. This implied discount rate serves as a baseline for estimating the specific discount rate for each reporting unit.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The discount rate used is the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of equity and debt (“cost of capital”) derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. Our weighted average cost of capital is adjusted for each reporting unit to reflect a risk factor, if necessary, for each reporting unit. We perform sensitivity tests with respect to growth rates and discount rates used in the income approach. We believe the income approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the respective reporting unit’s expected long-term operations and cash flow performance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We considered historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates used in our analysis. For fiscal 2016, the material assumptions used for the income approach were eight years of projected net cash flows and a long-term growth rate of3% for both the MP and IDP reporting units. A discount rate of 15% and 16% was used for the MP and IDP reporting units, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In applying the market approach, valuation multiples are derived from historical and projected operating data of selected guideline companies, which are evaluated and adjusted, if necessary, based on the strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit relative to the selected guideline companies. The valuation multiples are then applied to the appropriate historical and/or projected operating data of the reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value. We believe the market approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value using multiples from companies with operations and economic characteristics similar to its reporting units. We weighted the results of the income approach and the results of the market approach at 50% each and for the MP and IDP reporting units, concluded that the fair value of the reporting units was determined to be substantially in excess of the carrying value, and as such, no further analysis was warranted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under the income approach, the following indicates the sensitivity of key assumptions utilized in the assessment. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the fair value of the MP and IDP reporting units by approximately $660.0 million and $140.0 million, respectively, while a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the fair value of the MP and IDP reporting units by approximately $560.0 million and</p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$110.0 million, respectively. A one percentage point decrease in the long-term growth rate would have decreased the fair value of the MP and IDP reporting units by approximately $290.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively, while a one percentage point increase in the long-term growth rate would have increased the fair value of the MP and IDP reporting units by approximately $340.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In fiscal year 2015, we performed a qualitative assessment of our reporting units and as a result of our analysis, we determined that there were no indicators of impairment and no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In fiscal 2015, as a result of the Business Combination, we recorded IPRD of$470.0 million. IPRD was recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&amp;D efforts or impairment. The fair value of the acquired IPRD was determined based on an income approach using the &quot;excess earnings method,&quot; which estimated the value of the intangible assets by discounting the future projected earnings of the asset to present value as of the valuation date. Upon completion of development, acquired IPRD assets are transferred to finite-lived intangible assets and amortized over their useful lives. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we completed and transferred into developed technology approximately $220.0 million and $203.0 million, respectively, of IPRD. We performed a qualitative assessment of the remaining IPRD during fiscal 2017 and concluded that IPRD was not impaired.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">48</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017-2/Image_017.png"/></span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intangible Assets with Definite Lives</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intangible assets are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license.Finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of technology licenses, customer relationships, developed technology, a wafer supply agreement, trade names and backlog resulting from business combinations and are subject to amortization.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Technology licenses are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the technology or the term of the license agreement, ranging from approximately five to eight years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fair value of customer relationships acquired during fiscal years 2013, 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the “with and without method,&quot; in which the value of the asset is determined by the difference in discounted cash flows of the profitability of the Company &quot;with&quot; the asset and the profitability of the Company &quot;without&quot; the asset. Customer relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, ranging from three to ten years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fair value of developed technology acquired during fiscal years 2013, 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the &quot;excess earnings method,&quot; which estimated the value of the intangible assets by discounting the future projected earnings of the asset to present value as of the valuation date.

Under this method, the fair value was estimated by discounting to present value the additional savings from expense reductions in operations at a discount rate to reflect the risk inherent in the wafer supply agreement as well as any tax benefits. The wafer supply agreement was amortized on a units of use activity method over its useful life of approximately four years and was fully amortized as of April 2, 2016.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fair value of trade names acquired in fiscal years 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the &quot;relief from royalty method,&quot; in which the value of the asset is determined by discounting the future projected cash flows generated from the trade name&#39;s estimated royalties. Trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of two to three years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fair value of backlog acquired in fiscal 2015 was determined based on an income approach using the &quot;excess earnings method&quot; and was fully amortized as of April 2, 2016.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fair value of the non-compete agreements acquired in fiscal 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the &quot;incremental income method&quot; over the useful life of two years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We regularly review identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life has changed from the original estimate or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts.

Changes in taxable income, market conditions, U.S. or international tax laws, and other factors may change our judgment regarding whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the net deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding changes in the valuation allowance and net deferred tax assets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As part of our financial process, we also assess the likelihood that our tax reporting positions will ultimately be sustained.

The interest rates on this facility are variable; however, since we have no outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement, there is no interest rate risk related to this facility as of April 1, 2017.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Currency Exchange Rates</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a global company, our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates. Our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations, and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results. The functional currency for most of our international operations is the U.S. dollar. We have foreign operations in Asia, Europe and Costa Rica, and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the U.S. Our international revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreign-based operations are, in some instances, denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies, such as the Renminbi, Euro, Pound Sterling, Costa Rican Colon, and Yen. If the U.S. dollar weakens compared to the Renminbi, Euro, Pound Sterling, Costa Rican Colon, Yen and other currencies, our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into U.S. dollars. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For fiscal 2017, we incurred a foreign currency loss of$3.2 million as compared to a loss of $0.7 million in fiscal 2016, which is recorded in “Other (expense) income.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">52</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017-2/Image_021.png"/></span></p></body></html>
