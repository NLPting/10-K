These markets compose the primary building blocks of the IoT.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mobile Devices</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In our largest market, mobile devices, the most significant trend today is the increasing demand for ubiquitous broadband mobile data. This is driven primarily by video, with data traffic for video exceeding data traffic for web browsing and voice. Compounding this, consumers want higher resolution screens and access to streaming media, real-time traffic/navigation, GPS, Bluetooth® connectivity, WiFi and other energy-consuming applications. In response, leading smartphone providers are adding 4G LTE bands of coverage to their flagship devices to reduce development costs and enable larger, more concentrated marketing budgets in support of fewer models.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They are also adding CA technology to enable simultaneous communication over multiple frequency bands. This helps network operators optimize spectral efficiency and provides an enhanced user experience for consumers. Both trends expand RF content and drive higher levels of integration, which can increase performance requirements for RF components and narrow the competitive field. We see these trends continuing, as consumers increasingly expect always-on, ultra-low latency, broadband connectivity and as smartphone manufacturers and network operators seek to enhance performance and the user experience generation-over-generation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">5</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017/Image_002.png"/></span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Defense and Aerospace</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The global defense and aerospace industries are sharply focused on balancing cost, performance and power consumption. The trends toward phased arrays and higher frequencies of operation are expanding the market opportunities for monolithic microwave integrated circuits (&quot;MMICs&quot;) and discrete PAs, LNAs, passive devices, die level solutions and multichip modules leveraging multiple semiconductor technologies and advanced packaging techniques. Additionally, as with all RF communications systems, spectrum is becoming increasingly crowded and requires interference-free connections which are addressed by premium filtering solutions. These factors continue to drive demand for increased reliability and performance to address current and next generation communications for defense and national security capabilities, both domestic and with international partners.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CPE WiFi</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In WiFi markets, consumer and enterprise demand for faster data rates, the growth in connected users and the higher performance requirements of 802.11ac and 802.11ax mandate best-in-class RF solutions. WiFi is continuing to proliferate within CPE, including routers, access points, set-top boxes and smart televisions, as well as in automobiles. As spectrum becomes more crowded, the demand for interference-free transmission and reception is expected to drive the demand for high performance filters in RF solutions for WiFi equipment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cellular Base Stations</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The widespread use of data-intensive applications has driven cellular operators to require more power-efficient designs and solutions that enable increased capacity from cellular networks. To meet network demand, network equipment manufacturers are using techniques such as CA, moving to new RF frequency bands that have wider channel bandwidths and incorporating cloud radio access networks, which use a virtual radio access technology and remote radio heads. As demand for data-intensive applications continues to grow, the next generation network, called 5G, is forecasted to begin commercial rollout in 2020. 5G networks will continue the progression of operating at much higher frequencies, likely at 28GHz and 39GHz. In the meantime, operators will continue to evolve the performance of their LTE networks and run field trials to prove out 5G technologies and solutions. The future trends in the base station market include implementation of Multiple Input Multiple Output (”MIMO”) and small cells.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Optical</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The optical market continues to evolve beyond what was historically a long haul, telecom application or a metro network application. These applications created networks of fiber optic cable that enabled connections in a transcontinental, regional or city-wide area enabling the high-speed backbone required to address the bandwidth needed for high speed voice or data networks. Today, the optical market continues to grow rapidly as cloud-based applications create a need for hyperscale data centers that require high speed interconnections to connect geographically distributed data center sites. The need for high throughput, efficient data centers, often characterized by cost per gigabit of data transferred, requires a blend of technology, power efficiency and integration capabilities to drive down cost.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Automotive Connectivity</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The automobile is becoming a more connected device with the addition of multiple RF based connectivity solutions such as satellite radio, in-car infotainment and LTE connectivity solutions. Looking forward, new standards are expected to be deployed that will connect the car to other vehicles or to highway infrastructure. All of these applications create opportunities that will drive the need for RF solutions that will enhance passenger comfort, convenience and safety. Most of these applications require AEC-Q100 qualified solutions, which is the standard in the automobile industry. Additionally, in this market most of the communications devices will need to share frequency spectrum with either licensed or unlicensed users.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Smart Home</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The smart home is a house that contains automated or remotely controlled devices. These devices include sensors that detect light, motion or temperature, or whether doors are open, closed, locked or unlocked, and actuators to implement a command such as lowering the temperature or opening your garage door. Typically, these devices can be controlled via the internet, by a computer or phone or through a direct peer-to-peer connection such as a television remote control. The solutions often utilize industry open standard technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (“BLE”), ZigBee, and Thread as well as proprietary solutions to link to a central gateway that connects to the internet.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">6</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017/Image_003.png"/></span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other Markets</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We also participate in a number of smaller or emerging markets including broadband cable, point-to-point radio, Very Small Aperture Terminal (&quot;VSAT&quot;), signal sources, space, smart meters and the emerging cellular machine-to-machine (M2M) market.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Products and Applications</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our semiconductor solutions serve RF, microwave and millimeter-wave applications.

We are also engaged with overall ecosystem providers to develop products beyond remote controls to address next generation smart home applications.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The majority of our products are multi-chip modules utilizing multiple semiconductor process technologies. These products have varying degrees of complexity and contain semiconductors and other components that are manufactured in-house or outsourced. We are a leading supplier of RF solutions and a leading manufacturer of GaAs HBT, GaAs pHEMT, GaN, SAW, TC-SAW and BAW products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We operate wafer fabrication facilities for the production of GaAs, GaN, SAW, TC-SAW and BAW wafers in Richardson, Texas; Apopka, Florida; Greensboro, North Carolina; and Hillsboro, Oregon. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we acquired an additional wafer fabrication facility in Farmers Branch, Texas, which we currently plan to use to expand our BAW filter capacity. We also use multiple silicon-based process technologies, including SOI, SiGe and CMOS. We outsource all silicon manufacturing to leading silicon foundries located throughout the world. We have a global supply chain and ship millions of units per day.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have our own flip chip and wafer-level packaging (“WLP”) technologies and also use external suppliers for these and other packaging technologies. In flip chip packages, the electrical connections are created directly on the surface of the die, which eliminates wirebonds so the die may be attached directly to a substrate or leadframe. This type of technology provides a higher density interconnection than wirebonded die and enables smaller form factors with improved thermal and electrical performance. We use WLP technologies for our SAW, TC-SAW and BAW filter products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Once semiconductor wafers are manufactured, they are singulated, or separated, into individual units called die. Prior to singulation of wafers into die, we regularly conduct wafer level tests which could include electrical validation, RF testing through the designed frequency bands, as well as visual inspection. For module products, the next step is assembly. During assembly, the die and other components are placed on high-density interconnect substrates to provide connectivity between the die and the components. This populated substrate is formed into a microelectronic package. Next, the products are tested for RF performance and prepared for shipment through a tape and reel process. We primarily use internal assembly facilities in the United States, China, Costa Rica and Germany, and we also utilize external suppliers. We also manufacture large volumes of WLP die and discrete filters that our customers directly assemble into their products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing yields can vary significantly between products, based on a number of factors, including product complexity and the maturity of our manufacturing processes. To maximize wafer yields and quality, we test products multiple times, maintain continuous reliability monitoring and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the production flow.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our internal manufacturing facilities require a high level of fixed costs, consisting primarily of occupancy costs, maintenance, repair, equipment depreciation, and fixed labor costs related to manufacturing and process engineering.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ICs and filter products are highly complex and sensitive to contaminants, and semiconductor fabrication requires highly controlled, clean environments. Wafers can be rejected, or die on a wafer can be found to be nonfunctional as a result of minute impurities, variances in the fabrication process or defects in the masks used to transfer circuits onto the wafers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017/Image_006.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our manufacturing facilities worldwide are certified to the ISO 9001 quality standard and select locations are certified to additional automotive (TS-16949), aerospace (AS-9100) and environmental (ISO 14001) standards. These stringent standards are audited and certified by third-party auditors in addition to our continuous internal self-audits. The ISO 9001 standard is based on a number of quality management principles including a strong customer focus, the motivation of top management, the process approach and continual improvement. ISO/TS-16949 is the highest international quality standard for the global automotive industry and incorporates ISO technical specifications that are more stringent than ISO 9001 quality management systems requirements. AS-9100 is the standardized quality management system for the aerospace industry. ISO 14001 is an internationally agreed upon standard for an environmental management system. We require that all of our key vendors and suppliers be compliant with these standards, as applicable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Raw Materials</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We purchase numerous raw materials, passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing processes. For our GaAs and GaN manufacturing operations, we use several raw materials, including GaAs wafers and GaN on silicon carbide wafers. For our acoustic filter manufacturing operations, we use several raw materials, including wafer starting materials made from quartz, silicon, lithium niobate or lithium tantalite, as well as ceramic or metal packages. Relatively few companies produce these materials. We are leading the industry in developing SAW filters using six-inch lithium niobate wafers, and we have qualified more than one source for this wafer starting material. For all of our SAW operations, we utilize multiple qualified wafer and mask set vendors. Our most significant suppliers of ceramic surface mount packages are based in Japan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For our silicon-based integrated circuits, we use third-party foundries. High demand for SOI wafers for our switch products has led to supply constraints in the past, and we have addressed this by qualifying new silicon foundries and obtaining supply commitments from existing silicon suppliers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our manufacturing strategy includes a balance of internal and external sites (primarily for assembly operations), which helps reduce costs, provides flexibility of supply, and minimizes the risk of supply disruption. We routinely qualify multiple sources of supply and manufacturing sites to reduce the risk of supply interruptions or price increases and closely monitor suppliers’ key performance indicators. Our suppliers&#39; and our manufacturing sites are geographically diversified (with our largest volume sources distributed throughout Southern and Eastern Asia). We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials, passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing needs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Customers</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We design, develop, manufacture and market products for leading U.S. and international OEMs and ODMs. We also collaborate with leading baseband reference design partners located primarily in the U.S. and China.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We provided our products to our largest end customer, Apple Inc. (&quot;Apple&quot;), through sales to multiple contract manufacturers, which in the aggregate accounted for 34%, 37%, and 32% of total revenue in fiscal years2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (&quot;Huawei&quot;) accounted for 11%, 12% and 7% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Samsung Electronics, Co., Ltd. accounted for 7%, 7% and 14% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These customers primarily purchase cellular RF and WiFi solutions offered by our MP segment for a variety of mobile devices, including smartphones, notebook computers, wearables, tablets and cellular-based applications for the IoT. In fiscal 2017, Huawei was the largest customer for our IDP segment, primarily purchasing solutions for base stations, telecom transport and WiFi-enabled CPE applications.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some of our sales to overseas customers are made under export licenses that must be obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Information about revenue (including segment revenue), operating profit or loss and total assets is presented in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">10</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017/Image_007.png"/></span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales and Marketing</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We sell our products worldwide directly to customers as well as through a network of domestic and foreign sales representative firms and distributors. We select our domestic and foreign sales representatives based on technical skills and sales experience, the presence of complementary product lines and the customer base served. We provide ongoing training to our internal and external sales representatives and distributors to keep them educated about our products. We maintain an internal sales and marketing organization that is responsible for key account management, application engineering support for customers, sales and advertising literature, and technical presentations for industry conferences. Our sales and customer support centers are located near our customers throughout the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our web site contains extensive product information, and we publish a comprehensive product selection guide annually. Our global team of application engineers interacts with customers during all stages of design and production, maintains regular contact with customer engineers, provides product application notes and engineering data, and assists in the resolution of technical problems. We maintain close relationships with our customers and platform providers and provide them strong technical support to help anticipate future product needs and enhance their customer experience.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We maintain a high level of investment in research and development (&quot;R&amp;D&quot;) to develop the advanced technologies and products necessary to lead in the markets we serve. Our R&amp;D activities focus primarily on large, competitive design win opportunities for major programs at key customers, which typically requires us to improve the year-over-year functional density, performance, size and cost of our products. We also devote significant R&amp;D resources for targeted development of new products for general release to various markets. Our R&amp;D efforts require us to focus on both continuous improvement in our processes for design and manufacture as well as innovation in fundamental areas like materials, simulation and modeling, circuit design, device packaging and test.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have developed several generations of GaAs, GaN, BAW and SAW process technologies that we manufacture internally. We invest in these technologies to improve device performance, reduce die size and reduce manufacturing costs. We also help develop and qualify technologies made by key suppliers, including SOI for switches and RF signal conditioning solutions, SiGe and InP for amplifiers, and CMOS for power management devices and SoC solutions. We combine these external technologies with our proprietary design methods, intellectual property and other expertise to improve performance, increase integration and reduce the size and cost of our products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We invest in GaN process technologies and continue to develop and release new GaN-based products to exploit GaN’s performance advantages. The inherent wide band gap, high electron mobility, and high breakdown voltage characteristics of GaN semiconductor devices offer significant performance advantages versus competing technologies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We develop and qualify advanced packaging technologies to allow us to eliminate wire bonds, reduce component size and height, improve performance and reduce package costs. We are also investing in large scale module assembly and test capabilities to bring these technologies to market in very high volumes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred approximately $470.8 million, $448.8 million and $257.5 million, respectively, in R&amp;D expenses. We expect to continue to spend substantial funds on R&amp;D in support of our growth and product diversification.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We operate in a competitive industry characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions. Our customers’ product life cycles are often short, and our competitiveness depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors, anticipate changing customer requirements and successfully develop and launch new products while reducing our costs. Our competitiveness is also affected by the quality of our customer service and technical support and our ability to design customized products that address each customer’s particular requirements within their cost limitations. The selection process for our products to be included in our customers’ products is highly competitive, and our customers provide no guarantees that our products will be included in the next generation of products introduced.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">11</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017/Image_008.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We compete primarily with the following companies: Analog Devices, Inc.; Broadcom Limited; M/A-COM Technology Solutions, Inc.; Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.; Northrop Grumman Corporation; Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.; Skyworks Solutions, Inc.; and Sumitomo Electric Device Innovations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many of our current and potential competitors have entrenched market positions and customer relationships, established patents and other intellectual property and substantial technological capabilities. In some cases, our competitors are also our customers or suppliers. Additionally, many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do, which may allow them to implement new technologies and develop new products more quickly than we can.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intellectual Property</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We believe our intellectual property, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, is important to our business, and we actively seek opportunities to leverage our intellectual property portfolio to promote our business interests. We also actively seek to monitor and protect our global intellectual property rights and to deter unauthorized use of our intellectual property and other assets. Such efforts can be difficult because of the absence of consistent international standards and laws. Moreover, we respect the intellectual property rights of others and have implemented policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of infringing or misappropriating third party intellectual property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patent applications are filed within the U.S. and in other countries where we have a market presence. On occasion, some applications do not mature into patents for various reasons, including rejections based on prior art. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as</p><ol id="l2"><ol id="l3"><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">laws. We have more than 1,200 patents that expire from 2017 to 2037. We also continue to acquire patents through acquisitions or direct prosecution efforts and engage in licensing transactions to secure the right to practice third parties’ patents. In view of our rapid innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes, there is no guarantee that our products will not be obsolete before the related patents expire or are granted. However, we believe the duration and scope of our most relevant patents are sufficient to support our business, which as a whole is not significantly dependent on any particular patent or other intellectual property right. As we expand our products and offerings, we also seek to expand our patent prosecution efforts to cover such products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We periodically register federal trademarks, service marks and trade names that distinguish our product brand names in the market. We also monitor these marks for their proper and intended use. Additionally, we rely on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our interest in confidential and proprietary information that gives us a competitive advantage, including business strategies, unpatented inventions, designs and process technology. Such information is closely monitored and made available only to those employees whose responsibilities require access to the information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our sales are the result of standard purchase orders or specific agreements with customers. We maintain Qorvo-owned finished goods inventory at certain customers’ “hub” locations and do not recognize revenue until our customers draw down the inventory at these hubs. Our customers’ projections of consumption of hub inventory and quantities on purchase orders, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently revised within agreed-upon lead times to reflect changes in the customers’ needs. Because industry practice allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment, and with little or no penalty, we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On April 1, 2017, we had more than 8,600 employees. We believe that our future prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain skilled employees. Competition for skilled personnel is intense, and the number of persons with relevant experience, particularly in RF engineering, product design and technical marketing, is limited. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. A number of our employees in Germany (less than 5% of our global workforce as of April 1, 2017) are represented by internal works councils. We have never experienced any work stoppage, and we believe that our current employee relations are good.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom:

We provide our own manufacturing waste water treatment and disposal for most of our manufacturing facilities and we have contracted for the disposal of hazardous waste. State agencies require us to report usage of environmentally hazardous materials, and we have retained appropriate personnel to help ensure compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. We believe that costs arising from existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are an ISO 14001 certified manufacturer with a comprehensive Environmental Management System (“EMS”) in place in order to help ensure control of the environmental aspects of the manufacturing process. Our EMS mandates compliance and establishes appropriate checks and balances to minimize the potential for non- compliance with environmental laws and regulations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We actively monitor the hazardous materials that are used in the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products, particularly materials that are retained in the final product. We have developed specific restrictions on the content of certain hazardous materials in our products, as well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and subcontractors. This helps to ensure that our products are compliant with the requirements of the markets into which the products will be sold. For example, our products are compliant with the European Union RoHS Directive (2011/65/EU on the Restriction of Use of Hazardous Substances), which prohibits the sale in the European Union market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing certain families of substances above a specified threshold.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We do not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in fiscal2018.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">13</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017/Image_010.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Access to Public Information</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We make available, free of charge through our website (http://www.qorvo.com), our annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q (including related filings in XBRL format) and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &quot;Exchange Act&quot;) as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these reports with, or furnish them to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
