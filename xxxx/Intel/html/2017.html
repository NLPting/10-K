The increased cost of constructing new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers has led to a reduced number of companies that can build and equip leading-edge manufacturing facilities. Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries and subcontractors for manufacturing and assembly and test needs. We provide foundry services as an alternative to such foundries.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">8</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017/Image_007.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing and Assembly and Test</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2016, the majority of our wafer manufacturing was conducted within the U.S. Manufacturing conducted within and outside the U.S. may be impacted by the timing of a facility’s transition to a newer process technology, as well as a facility’s capacity utilization.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We manufacture our products in facilities at the following locations:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">a17029esmapfin2a02.jpg</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of December 31, 2016, our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers, with a substantial majority manufactured using our 14nm and 22nm process technologies. We continue to develop new generations of manufacturing process technology and realize the benefits which enable silicon designs with less space per transistor, reduced heat output from each transistor, and increased number of integrated features on each chip. These advancements make possible innovations of new products with higher functionality while controlling power, cost, and size. We incur factory start-up costs as we ramp our facilities for a new process technology. In 2017, we announced plans to complete our Arizona facility which is targeted for 7nm process technology.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We use third-party foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components, including communications, connectivity, networking, FPGA, and memory products. In addition, we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture board-level products and systems. We purchase certain communications and connectivity products from external vendors primarily in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition to the assembly and test facilities presented on the map, we use subcontractors to augment capacity to perform assembly and test of certain products, primarily chipsets and communications, FPGAs, connectivity, and memory products.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We utilize a multi-source strategy for our memory business to enable a robust and flexible supply chain. In 2016, we began ramping our facility in Dalian, China to produce leading-edge non-volatile memory. This expansion enables us to maintain a cost-effective strategy to best serve our customers in 3D NAND. In addition to our strategic investments to manufacture memory internally, we have a supplemental supply agreement with Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron), as well as capacity from the joint venture, IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT) factory in Lehi, Utah. For further information on IMFT, see &quot;Note 9: Investments&quot; in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our employment and operating practices are consistent with, and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by, local country law. Intel expects all suppliers to comply with the Intel Code of Conduct and the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct, both of which set standards that address the rights of workers to safe and healthy working conditions, environmental responsibility, compliance with privacy and data security obligations, and compliance with applicable laws.

Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, usually 30 days after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Distribution</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over time, our larger customers have generally moved to lean-inventory or just-in-time operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products. As our customers continue to lower their inventories, our processes to fulfill their orders have evolved to meet their needs. As a result, our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. Our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Only a small portion of our orders are non-cancelable, and the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seasonal Trends</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Marketing</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known Intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel<span class="s3">® </span>Quark™, Intel <span class="s3">® </span>Atom™, Intel <span class="s3">® </span>Celeron<span class="s3">®</span>, Intel <span class="s3">® </span>Pentium<span class="s3">®</span>, Intel <span class="s3">® </span>Xeon<span class="s3">®</span>, Intel <span class="s3">® </span>Xeon Phi™, and Intel<span class="s3">® </span>Itanium<span class="s3">® </span>trademarks make up our processor brands.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 171pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">12</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017/Image_011.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We promote brand awareness and preference, and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press relations. We market to consumer and business audiences, and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as all-in-one devices and 2 in 1 systems powered by Intel. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as connectivity and communications.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the Intel Inside <span class="s3">® </span>program. This program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Through the Intel Inside program, certain customers are licensed to place Intel<span class="s3">® </span>logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel<span class="s3">® </span>brands, subject to customers meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intel owns significant intellectual property (IP) and related IP rights around the world that relate to our products, services, R&amp;D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress rights, and maskwork rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. Such efforts can be difficult, however, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have obtained patents in the U.S. and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire; in some cases, our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted. As we expand our products into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&amp;D efforts, we purchase patents from third parties to supplement our patent portfolio. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other IP, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and platform products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors’ products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 171pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">13</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2017/Image_012.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have a long history of leadership in corporate responsibility and set ambitious goals and drive improvements in key focus areas of environmental sustainability, supply chain responsibility, diversity and inclusion, and social impact.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are committed to environmental sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives by working proactively with governments, environmental groups, and industry. To minimize the environmental impact of our global manufacturing operations, we invest in conservation projects and set company-wide environmental targets, seeking to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, water use, and waste generation. For the past nine years, we have been the largest voluntary corporate purchaser of green power in the U.S. according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, helping to stimulate the market for green power and reduce energy costs. We seek to reduce the environmental impact of our products through product ecology and e-waste initiatives and by designing products with improved energy-efficient performance, which helps us meet customer needs and identify market expansion opportunities. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the world’s environmental challenges, and we are joining forces with others to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to address climate change and water conservation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are committed to advancing supply chain responsibility, as we believe this creates value by reducing risk, improving product quality, and raising the overall performance of our suppliers. Our efforts are designed to protect vulnerable workers throughout the global supply chain and include setting clear supplier expectations, investing in assessments, audits, and capability-building programs, and collectively addressing issues through our leadership in the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC). We have also led the industry on the conflict minerals issue and have worked extensively since 2008 to put in place processes and systems to develop ethical sourcing of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold for Intel and to prevent profits from the sale of those minerals from funding conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. Since 2013, we have manufactured microprocessors that are DRC conflict-free for tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold. We continue our work to establish responsible mineral supply chains for our company as well as our industry.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diversity and inclusion are integral parts of our corporate strategy and vision. We believe that investing in training, diversity, benefits programs, and education helps us to attract and retain a talented workforce. In 2015, Intel set a goal to achieve full representation of women and underrepresented minorities in our U.S. workforce by 2020, reflecting talent available in the marketplace. We plan to spend $300 million to support this goal and accelerate diversity and inclusion—not just at Intel, but across the technology industry at large.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We and the Intel Foundation, a charitable organization, advance social impact initiatives and collaborative engagements to empower the next generation of innovators and expand economic opportunity for young people around the world through programs that increase access to technology skills and provide hands-on innovation experiences. Our social impact initiatives build trust with key stakeholders, support our long-term talent and diversity objectives, and support expansion of future market opportunities.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For more information about our corporate responsibility efforts, refer to our Corporate Responsibility Report available on Intel&#39;s website.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Distribution of Company Information</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.intel.com/" class="s12" target="_blank">Our Internet address is </a><a href="http://www.intel.com/" class="a" target="_blank">www.intel.com</a>.
