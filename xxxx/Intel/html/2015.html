BUSINESS</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Company Overview</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We design and manufacture advanced integrated digital technology platforms. A platform consists of a microprocessor and chipset, and may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services. We sell these platforms primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), and industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries . Our platforms are used to deliver a wide range of computing experiences in notebooks (including Ultrabook<span class="s1">™ </span>devices), 2 in 1 systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, and the Internet of Things (including wearables, transportation systems, and retail devices ). We also develop and sell software and services primarily focused on security and technology integration. We were incorporated in California in 1968 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1989.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Company Strategy</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our vision is if it is smart and connected, it is best with Intel. As a result, we offer complete and connected computing solutions, both hardware and software, and continue to drive &quot;Moore’s Law.&quot; Over time, the number of devices connected to the Internet and to one another has grown from hundreds of millions to billions. This number continues to grow and the variety of devices also continues to increase. The combination of embedding computing into devices and connecting them to the Internet, known as the Internet of Things, as well as a build-out of the cloud infrastructure supporting these devices, is driving fundamental changes in the computing industry. As a result, we are transforming our primary focus from the design and manufacture of semiconductor chips for personal computers (PCs) and servers to the delivery of more complete platform solutions consisting of hardware and software platforms and supporting services.

Moore&#39;s Law predicted that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years. We continue executing to Moore’s Law by enabling new devices with higher functionality and complexity while controlling power, cost, and size. In keeping with Moore&#39;s Law, we drive a regular and predictable upgrade cycle—introducing a new microarchitecture approximately every two to three years and ramping the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening periods . We refer to this as our &quot;tick-tock&quot; technology development cadence. Through this cycle, we continue to push progress by designing and putting transistor innovations into high-volume production. We aim to have the best process technology, and unlike many semiconductor companies, we primarily manufacture our products in our own facilities. This in-house manufacturing capability enables us to optimize performance, shorten our time to market, and scale new products more rapidly. We believe this competitive advantage will be extended in the future as the costs to build leading-edge fabrication facilities increase, and as fewer semiconductor companies will be able to combine platform design and manufacturing.</span></p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;"><i>Architecture and Platforms. </i>We are developing a wide range of solutions for devices that span the compute continuum and allow for computing experiences in notebooks, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, and the Internet of Things.

The marketplace can change quickly in response to the introduction of such technologies and products and other factors such as changes in customer and end-user requirements, expectations, and preferences. As technologies evolve and new market segments emerge, the boundaries between the market segments that we compete in are also subject to change.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intel faces significant competition in the development and market acceptance of our products in this environment. Our platforms, based on Intel architecture, are positioned to compete across the compute continuum, from the lowest power and ultra-mobile devices to the most powerful data center servers. Our platforms, which have integrated hardware and software, offer customers benefits such as ease of use, savings in total cost of ownership, and the ability to scale systems to accommodate increased usage.</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competitors</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We compete against other companies that make and sell platforms, other silicon components, and software to businesses that build and sell computing and communications devices to end users. Our competitors also include companies that sell goods and services to businesses that utilize them for their internal and/or customer-facing processes (e.g., businesses running large data centers). In addition, we face competition from OEMs, ODMs, and other industrial and communications equipment manufacturers that, to some degree, choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor and software assets. By doing so, these competitors may be attempting to offer greater differentiation in their products and to increase their share of the profits for each finished product they sell. Continuing changes in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or business collaborations could also have a significant impact on our competitive position.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are a leading provider in the PC and data center segments, where we face existing and emerging competition. In the PC market segment, ultra- mobile devices—such as tablets and smartphones offered by numerous vendors— have become significant competitors to PCs for many usages. Most of these small devices currently use applications processors based on the ARM* architecture; feature low-power, long battery-life operation; and are built in SoC formats that integrate numerous functions on one chip.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the data center segment, our data center platforms face emerging competition from companies using ARM architecture or other technologies. Internet cloud computing and high-performance computing are areas of significant targeted growth for us in the data center segment, and we face strong competition in these market segments.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are a relatively new entrant to the segments for tablets, smartphones, and similar ultra-mobile devices. We have adjusted our product roadmaps to emphasize the development of low-power SoC chips for such devices, as well the Internet of Things.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the Internet of Things market segment, we have a long-standing position as a supplier of components and software for embedded products, and this marketplace is significantly expanding with increasing types and numbers of smart and connected devices for industrial, commercial, and consumer uses. In this growing market segment, we face numerous large and small incumbent competitors as well as new entrants that use ARM architecture and other operating systems and software.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">McAfee is a major provider of digital security products and services to businesses and consumers. Numerous competitors offer security products and services, and we seek to offer competitive differentiation by integrating hardware and software security features in many of our offerings and to have security offerings in numerous market segments, including mobile and embedded devices and for data centers.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, innovative design, features, price, quality, reliability, brand recognition, and availability. The importance of these factors will vary by the type of end system for the products. For example, performance might be among the most important factors for our products for data center servers, while price and integration might be among the most important factors for our products for tablets<span class="s11">, </span>smartphones, and other mobile devices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_013.png"/></span></p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competitive Advantages</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our products&#39; ability to operate on multiple operating systems in end-user products and platforms operated or sold by third parties, including OEMs, is a key competitive advantage. We seek to optimize our products for multiple operating systems and invest substantial resources working with third parties to do so, but such investments are risky given that it is not clear which products will succeed in the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Another key competitive advantage is our market lead in transitioning to the next-generation process technology and bringing products to market using such technology. We have products in the market manufactured using our 14nm process technology and are currently working on the development of our next-generation 10nm process technology. We believe that these transitions will offer significant improvements in one or more of the following areas: performance, new features, energy efficiency, and cost<span class="s11">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Moreover, the combination of our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities with our global architecture design teams is another important competitive advantage. We have made significant capital and R&amp;D investments into this integrated manufacturing network, which enables us to have more direct control over our processes, quality control, product cost, production timing, performance, power consumption, and manufacturing yield. The increased cost of constructing new fabrication facilities supporting smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers has led to a smaller pool of companies that can afford to build and equip leading-edge manufacturing facilities. Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries and subcontractors such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. and GlobalFoundries Inc. for manufacturing and assembly and test needs. We provide foundry services as an alternative to such foundries.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing and Assembly and Test</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of December 27, 2014, 70% of our wafer fabrication, including microprocessors and chipsets, was conducted within the U.S. at our facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, and Massachusetts. Our Massachusetts fabrication facility is our last manufacturing facility on 200 millimeter (mm) wafers and is expected to cease production in Q1 2015. The remaining 30% of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the U.S. at our facilities in Israel and China. Our fabrication facility in Ireland is currently transitioning to our 14nm process technology, with manufacturing expected to ramp in the second half of 2015. Wafer fabrication conducted within and outside the U.S. may be impacted by the timing of a facility’s transition to a newer process technology, as well as a facility’s capacity utilization.</p><p

style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of December 27, 2014, a substantial majority of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 14nm, 22nm, and 32nm process technology. As we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology, we incur significant start-up costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing. However, continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs. The benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor, reducing heat output from each transistor, and increasing the number of integrated features on each chip. These advancements can result in new devices with higher functionality and complexity while controlling power, cost, and size. In addition, with each shift to a new process technology, we are able to produce more microprocessors per square foot of our wafer fabrication facilities. The costs to develop our process technology are significantly less than adding capacity by building additional wafer fabrication facilities using older process technology.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">10</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_014.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We use third-party foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components, including communication and connectivity products. In 2014, we qualified our first SoC application processor and baseband 3G solution, code-named &quot;SoFIA,&quot; which will be fabricated by a third-party foundry. In addition, we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture board-level products and systems. We purchase certain communication and connectivity products from external vendors primarily in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Following the manufacturing process, the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test. We perform our components assembly and test at facilities in Malaysia, China, and Vietnam . Our assembly and test facility in Costa Rica ceased production in Q4 2014. To augment capacity, we use subcontractors to perform assembly and test of certain products, primarily chipsets and communication and connectivity products.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our NAND flash memory products are manufactured by IMFT and Micron using 20nm or 25nm process technology, and assembly and test of these products is performed by Micron and other external subcontractors.

Intel expects all suppliers to comply with our Code of Conduct and the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct, both of which set standards that address the rights of workers to safe and healthy working conditions, environmental responsibility, compliance with privacy and data security obligations, and compliance with applicable laws.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have thousands of suppliers, including subcontractors, providing our various materials, equipment, and service needs. We set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments and audits. We communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources, but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country. In those cases, we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply. We have entered into long-term contracts with certain suppliers to help ensure a stable supply of silicon and semiconductor manufacturing tools.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our products are typically manufactured at multiple Intel facilities around the world or by subcontractors. However, some products are manufactured in only one Intel or subcontractor facility, and we seek to implement action plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility. See &quot;Risk Factors&quot; in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">11</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_015.png"/></span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are committed to investing in world-class technology development, particularly in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits. R&amp;D expenditures were $11.5 billion in 2014 ($10.6 billion in 2013 and $10.1 billion in 2012).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our R&amp;D activities are directed toward the delivery of solutions consisting of hardware and software platforms and supporting services across a wide range of computing devices. We are focused on developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products, which will in turn enable new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. We focus our R&amp;D efforts on advanced computing technologies, developing new microarchitectures, advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology, delivering the next generation of platforms, improving our platform initiatives, developing new solutions in emerging technologies including memory and the Internet of Things, as well as developing software solutions and tools. Our R&amp;D efforts are intended to enable new levels of performance and address areas such as energy efficiency, system-level integration, security, scalability for multi-core architectures, system manageability, and ease of use.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As part of our R&amp;D efforts, we plan to introduce a new Intel Core microarchitecture for desktops, notebooks (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems), and Intel Xeon processors approximately every two to three years and ramping the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening periods. We refer to this as our &quot;tick-tock&quot; technology development cadence, as illustrated below.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="546" height="167" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_016.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Advances in our silicon technology have enabled us to continue making Moore’s Law a reality. In 2014, we began manufacturing our 5th generation Intel Core processor family using our 14nm process technology. We are currently developing our next-generation Intel<span class="s1">® </span>microarchitecture, code-named &quot;Skylake,&quot; using our 14nm process technology, which we expect to release in the second half of 2015. We are also developing 10nm manufacturing process technology, our next-generation process technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have continued expanding on the advances anticipated by Moore’s Law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products optimized for a wider variety of applications. We have accelerated the Intel Atom processor-based SoC roadmap for ultra-mobile form factors, including tablets and smartphones, as well as notebooks (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems), the Internet of Things, and data center applications, from 32nm through 22nm to 14nm. Our Intel Atom processors for ultra-mobile form factors and the Internet of Things are transitioning to the same process technology as our leading-edge products. We expect that this acceleration will result in a significant reduction in transistor leakage, lower active power, and an increase in transistor density to enable more powerful, feature-rich smartphones and tablets with a longer battery life. The Intel Quark SoC is an ultra-low-power and low-cost architecture designed for the Internet of Things, from industrial machines to wearable devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With our continued focus on silicon and manufacturing technology leadership, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) in 2012, certain of which were amended in 2014 to further define the commercial terms between the parties. These amended agreements, in which Intel agreed to provide R&amp;D funding over five years, are intended to accelerate the development of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography projects and deep ultraviolet immersion lithography projects, including generic developments applicable to both 300mm and 450mm.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">12</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_017.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our R&amp;D activities range from designing and developing new products and manufacturing processes to researching future technologies and products. We continue to make significant R&amp;D investments in the development of SoCs to enable growth in ultra-mobile form factors. In addition, we continue to make significant investments in communications and connectivity for tablets, smartphones, and other connected devices, including mutlimode LTE modems.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our investment in Cloudera, completed in 2014, is evidence of our drive to bring big data analytics to the mainstream market through the joining of Cloudera&#39;s software platform and our data center architecture based on Intel Xeon processors. We also continue to invest in leading-edge foundry platforms and ecosystem partner development, graphics, high-performance computing, and communication and connectivity.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our R&amp;D model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies, leading standards initiatives, and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies, including joint pathfinding conducted between researchers at Intel Labs and our business groups. We centrally manage key cross-business group product initiatives to align and prioritize our R&amp;D activities across these groups. In addition, we may augment our R&amp;D activities by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar R&amp;D focus areas, as well as directly purchasing or licensing technology applicable to our R&amp;D initiatives. To drive innovation and gain efficiencies, we intend to utilize our investments in intellectual property and R&amp;D across our market segments.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of December 27, 2014, we had 106,700 employees worldwide, with approximately 51% of those employees located in the U.S.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales and Marketing</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Customers</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We sell our products primarily to OEMs and ODMs. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, we sell our products to other manufacturers, including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment. Our customers also include those who buy PC components and our other products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase Intel <span class="s1">® </span>microprocessors and other products from our distributors. We have a program that allows distributors to sell our microprocessors and other products in small quantities to customers of systems builders; our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2014, Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) accounted for 18% of our net revenue ( 17% in 2013 and 18% in 2012), Dell Inc. (Dell) accounted for 16% of our net revenue (15% in 2013 and 14% in 2012), and Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo) accounted for 12% of our net revenue ( 12% in 2013 and 11% in 2012). No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue during such periods. For information about net revenue and operating income by operating segment, and net revenue from unaffiliated customers by country, see &quot;Note 26: Operating Segments and Geographic Information &quot; in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales Arrangements</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, private-label branding, and other matters. Our sales are typically made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">13</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_018.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer, even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related cost of sales is deferred. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, generally 30 days after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. For information about our allowance for doubtful receivables, see &quot;Schedule II—Valuation and Qualifying Accounts&quot; in Part IV of this Form 10-K.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. We have the option to grant credit for, repair, or replace defective products, and there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit that may be granted to a distributor for defective products.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Distribution</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over time, our larger customers have generally moved to lean-inventory or just-in-time operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products. As our customers continue to lower their inventories, our processes to fulfill their orders have evolved to meet their needs. As a result, our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. Our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Only a small portion of our orders are non-cancelable, and the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seasonal Trends</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Marketing</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known Intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Quark, Intel Atom, Intel<span class="s1">® </span>Celeron<span class="s1">®</span>, Intel <span class="s1">® </span>Pentium<span class="s1">®</span>, Intel Xeon, Intel Xeon Phi, and Intel <span class="s1">® </span>Itanium<span class="s1">® </span>trademarks make up our processor brands.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We promote brand awareness and preference, and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press relations. We market to consumer and business audiences, and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as tablets, Ultrabook devices, and 2 in 1 systems powered by Intel. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as connectivity, communications, and security.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">14</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="690" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_019.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the Intel Inside <span class="s1">® </span>Program. This program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Through the Intel Inside Program, certain customers are licensed to place Intel logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to customers meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intel owns significant intellectual property (IP) and related IP rights around the world that relate to our products, services, R&amp;D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress rights, and maskwork rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. Such efforts can be difficult, however, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right. See &quot;Risk Factors&quot; in Part I, Item 1A, and &quot;Note 25: Contingencies&quot; in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have obtained patents in the U.S. and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire; in some cases, our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted. As we expand our products into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&amp;D efforts, we purchase patents from third parties to supplement our patent portfolio. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other IP, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and platform products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors’ products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Compliance with Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting company-wide performance targets for key resources and emissions. These targets address several parameters, including product design; chemical, energy, and water use; waste recycling; the source of certain minerals used in our products; climate change; and emissions.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a company, we focus on reducing natural resource use, the solid and chemical waste by-products of our manufacturing processes, and the environmental impact of our products. We currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety (EHS) laws and regulations. Over the past several years, we have significantly reduced the use of lead and halogenated flame retardants in our products and manufacturing processes.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We work with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), OEMs, and retailers to help manage e-waste (including electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives) and to promote recycling. The European Union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that let consumers return products for recycling. Many U.S. states and countries in Latin America and Asia also have or are developing similar e-waste take-back laws. Although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not the component products that we manufacture, the inconsistency of many e-waste take-back laws and the lack of local e-waste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">15</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_020.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We are an industry leader in our efforts to build ethical sourcing of minerals for our products, including &quot;conflict minerals&quot; from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. In 2013, we accomplished our goal to manufacture microprocessors that are DRC conflict-free for tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold. We continue our work to establish DRC conflict-free supply chains for our company and our industry, and have set a new goal that all products currently on our roadmap for 2016 and beyond will be DRC conflict-free for these four minerals.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We seek to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency. We take a holistic approach to power management, addressing the challenge at the silicon, package, circuit, microarchitecture, macroarchitecture, platform, and software levels. We recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk. For further information on the risks of climate change, see &quot;Risk Factors&quot; in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We see a potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. This could include items applied to utility companies that are passed along to customers, such as carbon taxes or costs associated with obtaining permits for our manufacturing operations, emission cap and trade programs, or renewable portfolio standards.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments, environmental groups, and industry to promote global environmental sustainability. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the world’s environmental challenges, and we are joining forces with industry, business, and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have been purchasing renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years. We purchase renewable energy certificates under a multi-year contract. This purchase has placed Intel at the top of the EPA’s Green Power Partnership for the past seven years and is intended to help stimulate the market for green power, leading to additional generating capacity and, ultimately, lower costs.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Distribution of Company Information</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.intel.com/" class="s14" target="_blank">Our Internet address is </a><a href="http://www.intel.com/" class="a" target="_blank">www.intel.com</a>.

RISK FACTORS</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including &quot;Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&quot; and our financial statements and the related notes.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Changes in product demand can harm our results of operation and financial condition.</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Demand for our products is variable and hard to predict.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Changes in the demand for our products may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to write down the value of our assets. Important factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include changes in:</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">business conditions, including downturns in the computing industry, or in the global or regional economies;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the level of our customers’ inventories;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">customer product needs;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">market acceptance of our products and maturing product cycles; and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the technology supply chain, including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events.</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We face significant competition.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond to these developments, our competitive position may weaken, and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete. Over recent years, our business focus has expanded and now includes the design and production of platforms for tablets, smartphones, and other devices across the compute continuum, including products for the Internet of Things, and related services. As a result, we face new sources of competition, including, in certain of these market segments, from incumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, integration, and energy efficiency of our products as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain consumer and market acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful R&amp;D effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors. For example, we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers. Our R&amp;D efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems, and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and the products we invest in and develop may not be well-received by customers. Our R&amp;D investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years, and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Additionally, the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for, or pricing of, our products.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including increased costs and reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">18</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2015/Image_023.png"/></span></p></body></html>
