BUSINESS</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Company Overview</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We design and manufacture advanced integrated digital technology platforms. A platform consists of a microprocessor and chipset, and may be enhanced by additional hardware, software, and services. We sell these platforms primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), and industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. Our platforms are used in a wide range of computing applications, such as notebooks (including Ultrabook™ devices and 2 in 1 systems), desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, automobile infotainment systems, automated factory systems, and medical devices. We also develop and sell software and services primarily focused on security and technology integration. We were incorporated in California in 1968 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1989.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Company Strategy</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our goal is to be the preeminent computing solutions company that powers the worldwide digital economy. Over time, the number of devices connected to the Internet and each other has grown from hundreds of millions to billions, and the variety of devices also continues to increase. The combination of embedding computing into devices and connecting them to the Internet, known as the Internet of Things, as well as a build-out of the cloud infrastructure supporting these devices is driving fundamental changes in the computing industry. As a result, we are transforming our primary focus from the design and manufacture of semiconductor chips for personal computing (PC) and servers to the delivery of solutions consisting of hardware and software platforms and supporting services across a wide range of computing devices. Examples of these solutions can be seen across the computing continuum, from the teraflops of operations per second for high performance computing (HPC) to the milliwatts of energy consumed by an embedded application.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Additionally, computing is becoming an increasingly mobile, personal, and ubiquitous experience. End users value consistency across devices that connect seamlessly and securely to the Internet and to each other. We enable this experience by innovating around energy-efficient performance, connectivity, and security.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To succeed in this changing computing environment, we have the following key objectives:</p><ul id="l1"><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">strive to ensure that Intel <span class="s1">® </span>technology is the best choice for any computing device, including PCs, data centers, cloud computing, ultra-mobile devices, and wearables;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">be the platform of choice for any operating system;</p></li></ul><ul id="l2"><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">maximize and extend our manufacturing technology leadership;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">extend to adjacent services such as security, cloud, and foundry;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">expand platforms into adjacent market segments to bring compelling new System-on-Chip (SoC) solutions and user experiences to ultra-mobile form factors including smartphones and tablets, as well as notebooks (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems), embedded systems, and microserver applications;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">develop platforms to enable devices that connect to the Internet of Things and to each other to create a computing continuum offering consumers a set of secure, consistent, engaging, and personalized forms of computing; and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">strive to lower the footprint of our products and operations as well as be an asset to the communities we work in.</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="690" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_001.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We use our core assets to meet these objectives. Our core assets include our silicon and manufacturing technology leadership, our architecture and platforms, our software and services, our security solutions, our customer orientation, our strategic investments, and our corporate stewardship.

We drive a regular two-year upgrade cycle—introducing a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramping the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. We refer to this as our “tick-tock” technology development cadence. With our continued focus on silicon and manufacturing technology leadership, we are collaborating on the development of 450-millimeter (mm) wafer technology and extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). We expect larger silicon wafers and enhanced lithography technologies with EUV to allow Moore’s Law to continue. Moore’s Law predicted that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years. We aim to have the best process technology, and unlike many semiconductor companies, we primarily manufacture our products in our own facilities. This in-house manufacturing capability allows us to optimize performance, shorten our time to market, and scale new products more rapidly. We believe this competitive advantage will be extended in the future as the costs to build leading-edge fabrication facilities increase, and as fewer semiconductor companies will be able to combine platform design and manufacturing.</span></p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;"><i>Architecture and Platforms. </i>We are developing a wide range of solutions for devices that span the computing continuum and allow for computing experiences from notebooks (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems), desktops, tablets, and smartphones to in-vehicle infotainment systems and beyond.

The markets for current and planned technologies can change quickly in response to the introduction of such technologies and products and other factors such as changes in consumer tastes.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intel faces significant competition in the development and market acceptance of technologies and products in this environment. Our platforms, based on Intel architecture, are positioned to compete across the spectrum of Internet-connected computing devices, from the lowest-power portable devices to the most powerful data center servers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">8</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="690" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_012.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are a leading provider in the PC and server segments, where we face existing and emerging competition. In the PC segment, smaller mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones, offered by numerous vendors have become significant competitors to PCs for many usages. Most of these small devices currently use applications processors based on the ARM* architecture; feature low-power, long battery-life operation; and are built in SoC formats which integrate numerous functions on one chip. In the server segment, our data center products and platforms face emerging competition from many new entrants using ARM architecture or other technologies.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are a relatively new entrant to the segments for tablets, smartphones and similar mobile devices. We have adjusted our product roadmaps to emphasize the development of low-power SoC chips for these and other devices. The boundaries between the various segments are changing as the industry evolves and new segments emerge.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have a long-standing position as a supplier of components and software for embedded products and this marketplace is significantly expanding with increasing types and numbers of Internet-connected devices for industrial, commercial and consumer uses, which we refer to as the Internet of Things. We face numerous large and small incumbent competitors as well as new entrants in this growing market segment that use ARM architecture as well as other operating systems and software.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, innovative design, features, price, quality, reliability, brand recognition and availability. The importance of these items will vary by the type of end system for the products. For example, performance might be among the most important factors for our products for servers, while price and integration might be among the most important factors for our products for tablets and smartphones.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are the owner of McAfee, a major provider of digital security products and services to businesses and consumers. There are numerous competitors offering security products and services, and we seek to offer competitive differentiation by integrating hardware and software security features in many of our offerings and to have security offerings in numerous market segments including mobile and embedded devices and for data centers.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The ability of our products to operate on multiple operating systems in end-user products and platforms operated or sold by third parties, including OEMs, is a key competitive advantage. We seek to optimize our products for multiple operating systems and invest substantial resources working with third parties to do so, but such investments are risky given that it is not clear which products will succeed in the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have competitors in each of the market segments including other companies that make and sell microprocessors, SoCs, other silicon components, software and platforms to businesses which build and sell computing and communications devices to end-users. We also compete against others selling these goods and services to businesses that utilize the products for their internal processes (e.g., businesses running large data centers). We also face competition from OEMs that, to some degree, choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor and software assets. By doing so, these OEMs may be attempting to offer greater differentiation in their products and to increase their share of the profits for each finished product they sell.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Continuing changes in the industry such as acquisitions, business collaborations or licensing scenarios (such as injunctions or other litigation outcomes), could have a significant impact on our competitive position.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of our important competitive advantages is the combination of our network of manufacturing, assembly and test facilities with our global architecture design teams. We have made significant capital and research and development (R&amp;D) investments into this integrated manufacturing network, which enables us to have more direct control over our processes, quality control, product cost, production timing, performance, power consumption, and manufacturing yield. The increased cost of constructing new fabrication facilities supporting smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers has led to a smaller pool of companies that can afford to build and equip leading-edge manufacturing facilities. Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries and subcontractors such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. and GlobalFoundries Inc. for manufacturing and assembly and test</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">needs.

microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 22nm and 32nm process technology. Our Massachusetts fabrication facility is our last manufacturing on 200mm wafers and is expected to cease production by the end of 2014. As we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology, we incur significant start-up costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing. However, continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs. The benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor, reducing heat output from each transistor, and increasing the number of integrated features on each chip. These advancements can result in microprocessors that are higher performing, consume less power, and cost less to manufacture. In addition, with each shift to a new process technology, we are able to produce more microprocessors per square foot of our wafer fabrication facilities. The costs to develop our process technology are significantly less than adding capacity by building additional wafer fabrication facilities using older process technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We use third-party foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components, including networking and communications products.

We set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments. We communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources, but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country. In those cases, we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply. We have entered into long-term contracts with certain suppliers to ensure a portion of our silicon supply.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 133pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">10</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="690" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_014.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our products are typically manufactured at multiple Intel facilities around the world or by subcontractors.

We are focused on developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products, which will in turn enable new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. We focus our R&amp;D efforts on advanced computing technologies, developing new microarchitectures, advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology, delivering the next generation of platforms, improving our platform initiatives, developing new solutions in emerging technologies including wearable devices and embedded applications, and developing software solutions and tools. Our R&amp;D efforts are intended to enable new levels of performance and address areas such as energy efficiency, security, scalability for multi-core architectures, system manageability, and ease of use.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As part of our R&amp;D efforts, we plan to introduce a new Intel Core microarchitecture for desktops, notebooks (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems), and Intel Xeon processors approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. We refer to this as our “tick-tock” technology development cadence as subsequently illustrated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="545" height="166" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_015.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Advances in our silicon technology have enabled us to continue making Moore’s Law a reality. We expect to begin manufacturing products using our 14nm process technology in Q1 2014. We are currently developing our 5th generation Intel Core processor family (code-named “Broadwell”) using our 14nm process technology, expected to be released in the second half of 2014. We are also developing 10nm manufacturing process technology, our next- generation process technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have continued expanding on the advances anticipated by Moore’s Law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products optimized for a wider variety of applications. We have accelerated the Intel Atom processor-based SoC roadmap for ultra-mobile form factors, including</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">smartphones and tablets, as well as notebooks (including Ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems), embedded systems, and microserver applications, from 32nm through 22nm to 14nm. We intend that Intel Atom processors for ultra-mobile form factors will eventually be on the same process technology as our leading-edge products. We expect that this acceleration will result in a significant reduction in transistor leakage, lower active power, and an increase in transistor density to enable more powerful, feature-rich smartphones and tablets with longer battery life. Intel Quark SoC, our newest technology announced in Q3 2013, is an ultra-low power and low-cost architecture designed for the Internet of Things, from industrial machines to wearable devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With our continued focus on silicon and manufacturing technology leadership, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) in 2012. These agreements, in which Intel purchased ASML securities and agreed to provide R&amp;D funding over five years, are intended to accelerate the development of 450mm wafer technology and EUV lithography.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 133pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">11</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="690" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_016.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our R&amp;D activities range from designing and developing new products and manufacturing processes to researching future technologies and products. We continue to make significant R&amp;D investments in the development of SoCs to enable growth in ultra-mobile form factors. In addition, we continue to make significant investments in wireless technologies including our work to develop a high-speed LTE solution for smartphones. Our second generation VoLTE product with LTE-advanced features, such as carrier aggregation, is expected to be available in the first half of 2014. We also continue to invest in graphics and HPC.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our R&amp;D model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies, leading standards initiatives, and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies, including joint pathfinding conducted between researchers at Intel Labs and our business groups. We centrally manage key cross-business group product initiatives to align and prioritize our R&amp;D activities across these groups. In addition, we may augment our R&amp;D activities by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar R&amp;D focus areas, as well as directly purchasing or licensing technology applicable to our R&amp;D initiatives.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of December 28, 2013, we had 107,600 employees worldwide ( 105,000 as of December 29, 2012), with approximately 51% of those employees located in the U.S. (51% as of December 29, 2012).</p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales and Marketing</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Customers</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We sell our products primarily to OEMs and ODMs. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, we sell our products to other manufacturers, including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment. Our customers also include those who buy PC components and our other products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase Intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors. We have a boxed processor program that allows distributors to sell our microprocessors in small quantities to customers of systems builders; boxed processors are also available in direct retail outlets.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 2013, Hewlett-Packard Company accounted for 17% of our net revenue ( 18% in 2012 and 19% in 2011), Dell Inc. accounted for 15% of our net revenue (14% in 2012 and 15% in 2011), and Lenovo Group Limited accounted for 12% of our net revenue ( 11% in 2012 and 9% in 2011). No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue during such periods. For information about net revenue and operating income by operating segment, and net revenue from unaffiliated customers by country, see “Note 27: Operating Segments and Geographic Information ” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales Arrangements</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world. Sales of our products are typically made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, private-label branding, and other matters. Most of our sales are made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer, even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related cost of sales is deferred. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, generally 30 days after shipment or delivery. Our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers to control credit risk to Intel arising from outstanding account balances. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis, and from this analysis, we establish credit limits and determine whether we will use one or more credit support devices, such as a parent guarantee or standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. For information about our allowance for doubtful receivables, see “Schedule II—Valuation and Qualifying Accounts” in Part IV of this Form 10-K.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 133pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">12</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="690" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_017.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. On most products, there is no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. We have the option to grant credit for, repair, or replace defective products, and there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit that may be granted to a distributor for defective products.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Distribution</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. We also utilize third-party sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory; instead, their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Over time, our larger customers have generally moved to lean-inventory or just-in-time operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products. As our customers continue to lower their inventories, our processes to fulfill their orders have evolved to meet their needs. As a result, our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. Our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Only a small portion of our orders is non-cancelable, and the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seasonal Trends</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Historically, our platform sales have generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Marketing</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our corporate marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known Intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Atom, Intel<span class="s1">® </span>Pentium<span class="s1">®</span>, Intel Xeon, Intel Xeon Phi and Intel <span class="s1">® </span>Itanium<span class="s1">® </span>trademarks make up our processor brands.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities include television, print, and Internet advertising, as well as press relations and social media, consumer and trade events, and industry and consumer communications. We market to consumer and business audiences, and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as Ultrabook and 2 in 1 systems, and for increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as Internet connectivity and security.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the Intel Inside <span class="s1">® </span>Program. This program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Through the Intel Inside Program, certain customers are licensed to place Intel logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the OEMs for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to the OEMs meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include television, print, and Internet marketing. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 133pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">13</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="690" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_018.png"/></span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intel owns significant intellectual property (IP) around the world that relates to our products, services, research and development, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress rights, and maskwork rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. Such efforts can be difficult, however, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, and “Note 26: Contingencies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have obtained patents in the U.S. and other countries. While our patents are an important element of our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire; in some cases, our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted. As we expand our products into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products. In addition to developing patents based on our own research and development efforts, we purchase patents from third parties to supplement our patent portfolio. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other IP, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and platform products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors’ products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Compliance with Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting company-wide performance targets for key resources and emissions. These targets address several parameters, including product design; chemical, energy, and water use; waste recycling; the source of certain minerals used in our products; climate change; and emissions.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a company, we focus on reducing natural resource use, the solid and chemical waste by-products of our manufacturing processes, and the environmental impact of our products. We currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of EHS laws and regulations. Over the past several years, we have significantly reduced the use of lead and halogenated flame retardants in our products and manufacturing processes.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We work with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), OEMs, and retailers to help manage e-waste (including electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives) and to promote recycling. The European Union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that let consumers return products for recycling. Many states in the U.S. have similar e-waste take-back laws. Although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not the component products that we manufacture, the inconsistency of many e-waste take-back laws and the lack of local e-waste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We are an industry leader in our efforts to build ethical sourcing of minerals for our products, including “conflict minerals” from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. In 2013, we accomplished our goal to manufacture microprocessors that are DRC conflict free for tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold. In 2014, we will continue our work to establish DRC conflict free supply chains for these minerals for our company and our industry.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 133pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">14</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="690" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_019.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We seek to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency. We take a holistic approach to power management, addressing the challenge at the silicon, package, circuit, micro-architecture, macro architecture, platform, and software levels. We recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk. For further information on the risks of climate change, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We see a potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. This could include items applied to utility companies that are passed along to customers, such as carbon taxes or costs associated with obtaining permits for our manufacturing operations, emission cap and trade programs, or renewable portfolio standards.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments, environmental groups, and industry to promote global environmental sustainability. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the world’s environmental challenges, and we are joining forces with industry, business, and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have been purchasing wind power and other forms of renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years. We purchase renewable energy certificates under a multi-year contract. This purchase has placed Intel at the top of the EPA’s Green Power Partnership for the past four years and is intended to help stimulate the market for green power, leading to additional generating capacity and, ultimately, lower costs.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Distribution of Company Information</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.intel.com/" class="s11" target="_blank">Our Internet address is </a><a href="http://www.intel.com/" class="a" target="_blank">www.intel.com</a>.

RISK FACTORS</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Changes in product demand may harm our financial results and are hard to predict.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If product demand decreases, our revenue and profit could be harmed. Important factors that could cause demand for our products to decrease include changes in:</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">business conditions, including downturns in the computing industry, regional economies, and the overall economy;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the level of customers’ inventories;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">customer product needs;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">market acceptance of our products and maturing product cycles; and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the technology supply chain, including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events.</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our operations have high costs—including costs related to facility construction and equipment, R&amp;D, and employment and training of a highly skilled workforce—that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. At the same time, demand for our products is highly variable and, in recent years, we have experienced declining orders in the traditional PC market segment, which has been negatively impacted by the growth in ultra-mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones<span class="s14">. </span>If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. Our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. Factory-planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation. If product demand increases, we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand. Our revenue and gross margin percentage can also be affected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses, including marketing expenses. Changes in product demand, and changes in our customers’ product needs, could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage, or require us to write down our assets.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We operate in highly competitive industries, and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological and market developments could harm our ability to compete.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We operate in highly competitive industries that experience rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to these developments, we might weaken our competitive position, and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete. As computing market segments emerge, such as smartphones, tablets, and consumer electronics devices, we face new sources of competition and customers with needs different from those of customers in the PC market segment. Some of our competitors are pursuing a vertical integration strategy, incorporating their SoC solutions into the smartphones and tablets they offer, which could make it less likely that they will adopt our SoC solutions. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships in these market segments. As the number and variety of Internet-connected devices increase, we need to continuously improve the cost, connectivity, integration, features, energy efficiency, and security of our platforms, among other things, to succeed in these market segments. In addition, we need to expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful R&amp;D effort, develop new products and production processes, and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors. For example, we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing, assembly and test facilities, including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers. Our R&amp;D efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems, and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful. We may be unable to develop and market new products successfully, and the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers. Our R&amp;D investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Additionally, the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for or pricing of our products. These types of events could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce revenue, increase costs, lower gross margin percentage, or require us to impair our assets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 133pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">17</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="690" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_022.png"/></span></p></body></html>
