motherboard-level solutions incorporating integrated circuits that are proprietary or sourced from manufacturers other than Broadcom. This competition, along with Moore&#39;s law, has resulted and may continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products in certain markets. We also may face competition from newly established competitors, suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies, and customers that choose to develop their own silicon solutions. We also expect to encounter consolidation in the markets in which we compete.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. Current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties, and may refuse to provide us with information necessary to permit the interoperability of our products with theirs.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. In addition, competitors may develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features, lower power requirements or lower costs. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “<i>Risk Factors</i>” under Item 1A of this Report for further discussion of the risks associated with competition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seasonality</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">An increasing number of our products continue to be incorporated into consumer electronic products, which are subject to seasonality and fluctuations in demand, and tend to have stronger sales in the middle of the fiscal year as manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling seasons.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intellectual Property</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: left;">Our success and future product revenue growth depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely primarily on patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. However, these may not provide meaningful or adequate protection for our intellectual property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 222pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">10</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2013/Image_011.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">We currently hold more than 9,000 U.S. and more than 3,850 foreign patents (up from more than 7,800 U.S. and more than 3,100 foreign patents from the prior year) and have more than 9,000 additional U.S. and foreign pending patent applications. We believe that no single patent is solely responsible for protecting our products and that the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and strategic partners, and typically control access to and distribution of product documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies and processes, develop similar technology independently, or design around our patents. As such, any rights granted under our patents may not provide us with meaningful protection. In addition, we may not be able to successfully enforce our patents against infringing products in every jurisdiction. See “<i>Risk Factors</i>” under Item 1A of this Report for further discussion of the risks associated with patents and intellectual property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: justify;">Some or all of our patents have in the past been licensed and may in the future be licensed to certain of our competitors through cross-license agreements, such as the Qualcomm Agreement. Moreover, because we have participated and continue to participate in developing various industry standards, we may be required to license some of our patents to others, including competitors, who develop products based on those standards.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Companies in and related to the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights. We are currently engaged in litigation and may need to engage in additional litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or the rights of our customers, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. In addition, we are currently engaged in litigation and may engage in future litigation with parties that claim that we infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For a detailed description of various outstanding intellectual property litigation matters, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">As of December 31, 2013 we had approximately 12,550 employees, including 9,800 individuals engaged in research and development,1,000 engaged in sales and marketing, 750 engaged in manufacturing operations, and 1,000 engaged in general and administrative activities.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Broadcom, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our Class A common stock will likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Our quarterly net revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter.

Contributions to our net revenue by these customers have increased in the last several years. Sales to our five largest customers represented 48.3%, 46.9% and 42.3% of our total net revenue in2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Sales to two significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total net revenue, represented 34.6%, 31.9% and 23.1% of our total net revenue in2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total net revenue for the foreseeable future. The loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Also, as our significant customers become larger relative to our business and the industry, they may be able to leverage pricing pressure through the supply chain, vertical integration or other avenues, thereby adversely affecting our gross margins.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">A significant portion of our revenue in any period may also depend on a single product design win with a large customer.
