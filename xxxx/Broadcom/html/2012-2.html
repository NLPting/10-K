Our leading customers currently shipping wired and/or wireless communications equipment and devices incorporating our products include:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l2"><li style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Alcatel-Lucent • Motorola Mobility</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Apple • Netgear</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Cisco • Nokia</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Dell • Pace</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">EchoStar • Samsung</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Hewlett-Packard • Thomson</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Huawei Technologies • ZTE</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Humax</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: left;">A small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our net revenue. Contributions to our net revenue by these customers have increased in the last several years. Sales to our five largest customers represented 47.2%, 42.6% and 38.6% of our net revenue in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2012, 2011 and 2010 sales to Samsung and Apple represented 17.3% and 14.6%, 10.0% and 13.1%, and 10.0% and 10.9% of our net revenue, respectively. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report. We expect that our key customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in 2013 and in the foreseeable future. We typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders that customers can generally cancel, change or defer on short notice without incurring a significant penalty.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: left;">We have assembled a large team of experienced engineers and technologists, many of whom are leaders in their particular field or discipline. As of December 31, 2012 we had approximately 8,700 research and development employees (or approximately 77% of our total employees), including over850 employees with Ph.D.s.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These key employees are involved in advancing our core technologies, as well as product development. We believe that increased intellectual property integration and the timely introduction of new products are essential to our growth. Because SoC solutions benefit from the same underlying core technologies, we are able to address a wide range of communications markets with a relatively focused investment in research and development. Our research and development expense was $2.32 billion,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$1.98 billion and $1.76 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These amounts included stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development of $368 million, $363 million and $342 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We have design centers throughout the United States, including our principal design facilities in Irvine, California and Santa Clara County, California. Internationally, we have design facilities in Asia, Europe, Israel and Canada. We anticipate establishing additional design centers in the United States and in other countries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">The cyclicality and seasonality of our industry growth do not meaningfully affect our R&amp;D costs on an absolute dollar basis, but can affect our R&amp;D costs as a percentage of revenue. We endeavor to manage our cost structure to attain long-term business objectives, rather than focusing on short-term profit targets. We view the predictability and stability of our engineering base as a source of competitive advantage. Accordingly, when necessary, we endeavor to reduce research and development costs primarily through slowing incremental hiring or through selectively exiting certain markets, and we typically only resort to broader staffing reductions when we believe our cash flow from operations is at risk of dropping below certain thresholds.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wafer Fabrication</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We depend on multiple foundry subcontractors located in Asia to manufacture a majority of our products.

This strategy also avoids the high capital cost of owning and operating semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities. See “<i>Risk Factors</i>” under Item 1A of this Report for a discussion of the risks associated with our dependence on independent foundry subcontractors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Most of our products are manufactured using complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, process technology. Our products are currently fabricated on a variety of processes ranging from 500 nanometers to 28 nanometers. We generally evaluate the benefits, on a product-by-product basis, of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies. Approximately 60% of our products are currently manufactured in 65 nanometers (with an increasing number of products being manufactured in 40 nanometers). We are designing most new products in 40 nanometers, 28 nanometers and 20 nanometers, and are beginning to evaluate FinFET technologies.

Lead-free solutions in electronic components and systems are receiving increasing attention within the semiconductor industry. Our products are compliant with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, or RoHS, the European legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead, and current European REACH (Regulation, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals) laws.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Product Distribution</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Due largely to the location of our customers and their fabrication facilities, the majority of our products are shipped internationally to customers through our distribution center in Singapore and a smaller portion domestically via an operations and distribution center in Irvine, California. Net product revenue derived from actual shipments to international destinations, primarily in Asia represented 96.8%, 96.9% and 95.6% of our net revenue in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">8</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012-2/Image_009.png"/></span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales and Marketing</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Our sales and marketing strategy is to achieve design wins with technology leaders by providing quality, state-of-the-art products, superior engineering execution, and superior sales, field application and engineering support. We market and sell our products in the United States through a direct sales force, distributors and manufacturers’ representatives. The majority of our domestic sales occur through our direct sales force, which is based in offices located in California and throughout the United States. We market and sell our products internationally through regional offices primarily in Asia, Europe and North America, as well as through a network of independent and fulfillment distributors and representatives in Asia, Australia, Europe and North America. We or our customers select these independent entities based on their ability to provide effective field sales, marketing communications and technical support to our customers. All international sales to date have been in</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. dollars.

This competition, along with Moore&#39;s law, has resulted and will continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products in certain markets. We also may face competition from newly established competitors, suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies, and customers that choose to develop their own silicon solutions. We expect to encounter continuing consolidation in the markets in which we compete.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. Current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties, and may refuse to provide us with information necessary to permit the interoperability of our products with theirs. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. In addition, competitors may develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features, lower power requirements or lower costs. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “<i>Risk Factors</i>” under Item 1A of this Report for further discussion of the risks associated with competition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012-2/Image_010.png"/></span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seasonality</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">An increasing number of our products are being incorporated into consumer electronic products, which are subject to seasonality and fluctuations in demand, and tend to have stronger sales in the middle of the fiscal year as manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling seasons.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intellectual Property</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: left;">Our success and future product revenue growth depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely primarily on patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. However, these may not provide meaningful or adequate protection for our intellectual property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">We currently hold more than 7,800 U.S. and more than 3,100 foreign patents (up from more than 6,000 U.S. and more than 2,550 foreign patents from the prior year) and have more than 7,700 additional U.S. and foreign pending patent applications. We believe that no single patent is solely responsible for protecting our products and that the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and strategic partners, and typically control access to and distribution of product documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies and processes, develop similar technology independently, or design around our patents. As such, any rights granted under our patents may not provide us with meaningful protection. In addition, we may not be able to successfully enforce our patents against infringing products in every jurisdiction. See “<i>Risk Factors</i>” under Item 1A of this Report for further discussion of the risks associated with patents and intellectual property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Some or all of our patents have in the past been licensed and likely will in the future be licensed to certain of our competitors through cross-license agreements, such as the Qualcomm Agreement. See the detailed discussion in the “<i>Overview</i>” section in Item 7. <i>Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</i>. Moreover, because we have participated and continue to participate in developing various industry standards, we may be required to license some of our patents to others, including competitors, who develop products based on those standards.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Companies in and related to the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights. We are currently engaged in litigation and may need to engage in additional litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or the rights of our customers, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. In addition, we are currently engaged in litigation and may engage in future litigation with parties that claim that we infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets. Such litigation will result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For a detailed description of our outstanding intellectual property litigation, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">As of December 31, 2012 we had approximately 11,300 employees, including8,700 individuals engaged in research and development, 1,050 engaged in sales and marketing, 700 engaged in manufacturing operations, and 850 engaged in general and administrative activities. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our employee relations are good.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Item 1A<span class="s2">. Risk Factors</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Broadcom, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our Class A common stock will likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 222pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">10</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012-2/Image_011.png"/></span></p></body></html>
