These reference platforms generally include an extensive suite of software drivers, as well as protocol and application layer software. By providing reference platforms that may ultimately be incorporated into our customers’ end products, we believe we enable our customers to achieve easier and faster transitions from the initial prototype designs through final production releases. We believe these reference platform designs also significantly enhance customers’ confidence that our products will meet their market requirements and product introduction schedules.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Customers and Strategic Relationships</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">We sell our products to leading wired and wireless communications manufacturers. We have also established strategic relationships with multiservice operators that provide wired and wireless communications services to consumers and businesses. Our leading customers currently shipping wired and/or wireless communications equipment and devices incorporating our products include:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l2"><li style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Alcatel-Lucent • Humax</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Apple • Pace</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Arris • Samsung</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Cisco • Technicolor</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Huawei Technologies • ZTE</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: left;">A small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our net revenue. Contributions to our net revenue by these customers have increased in the last several years. Sales to our five largest customers represented 44.1%, 48.3% and 46.9% of our net revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In 2014, 2013 and 2012 sales to Samsung represented 14.2%, 21.3%, and 17.3% of our net revenue, respectively. In 2014, 2013 and 2012 sales to Apple represented 14.0%, 13.3%, and 14.6% of our net revenue, respectively. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report. We expect that our key customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in 2015 and in the foreseeable future. We typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders that customers can generally cancel, change or defer on short notice without incurring a significant penalty.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: left;">We have assembled a large team of experienced engineers and technologists, many of whom are leaders in their particular field or discipline. As of December 31, 2014 we had approximately 8,000 research and development employees (or approximately 75% of our total employees), including over800 employees with Ph.D.s.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These key employees are involved in advancing our core technologies, as well as product development. We believe that increased intellectual property integration and the timely introduction of new products are essential to our growth. Because SoC solutions benefit from the same underlying core technologies, we are able to address a wide range of communications markets with a relatively focused investment in research and development. Our research and development expense was $2.37 billion,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$2.49 billion and $2.32 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These amounts included stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development of $304 million, $363 million and $368 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We have design centers throughout the United States, including our principal design facilities in Irvine, California and Santa Clara County, California, as well as Asia, Europe and the Middle East.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">6</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_007.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Our revenue and our research and development costs as a percentage of revenue are subject to the cyclicality and seasonality of our industry. Our research and development costs on an absolute dollar basis are not, however, meaningfully affected by these patterns. We endeavor to manage our cost structure to attain long-term business objectives, rather than focusing on short-term profit targets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wafer Fabrication</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We depend on multiple foundry subcontractors located in Asia to manufacture a majority of our products. Our key silicon foundries are:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l3"><li style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -7pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, or TSMC, in Taiwan;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -7pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">United Microelectronics Corporation in Singapore and Taiwan;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -7pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation in China; and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -7pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">GlobalFoundries, Inc. (formerly Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing) in Singapore and Germany.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">By subcontracting manufacturing, we focus resources on design and test applications where we believe we have greater competitive advantages. This strategy also avoids the high capital cost of owning and operating semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities. See “<i>Risk Factors</i>” under Item 1A of this Report for a discussion of the risks associated with our dependence on independent foundry subcontractors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Most of our products are manufactured using complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, process technology. Our products are currently fabricated on a variety of processes ranging from 500 nanometers to 28 nanometers. We generally evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies based on the benefits in performance, power and/or cost. In 2014, approximately 50% of our products were manufactured in 40 nanometers and30% in 65 nanometers. We are designing most new products in 40 nanometers and 28 nanometers, and are beginning to evaluate FinFET technologies. As we move to smaller geometries, we have become increasingly reliant on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for the manufacture of product at and below 40 nanometers. See “<i>Risk Factors</i>” under Item 1A of this Report for a discussion of the risks associated with transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Assembly and Test</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Our products are tested at either the wafer level and/or the packaged finished products level. Our product testing is conducted by independent foundries, and independent test subcontractors. The die are assembled into finished products by independent assembly and package subcontractors.

Our operations and quality engineering teams closely manage the interface between manufacturing and design engineering. We evaluate each assembly and foundry subcontractor. We also participate in quality and reliability monitoring by reviewing electrical and parametric data from our wafer foundry and assembly subcontractors. We closely monitor wafer foundry production to ensure consistent overall quality, reliability and yield levels. All of our principal independent foundries and package assembly facilities are currently ISO 9001 certified, a comprehensive International Standards Organization specified quality system acknowledgment. As part of our total quality program, we received ISO 9001 certification for our Singapore distribution facility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Environmental Management</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">We assess the environmental impact of our products to international standards. Our manufacturing subcontractors have registered our manufacturing flow to ISO 14000, the international standard related to environmental management. Lead-free solutions in electronic components and systems are receiving increasing attention within the semiconductor industry. Our products are compliant with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, or RoHS, the European legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead, and current European REACH (Regulation, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals) laws.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Product Distribution</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Due largely to the location of our customers and their fabrication facilities, the majority of our products are shipped outside of the United States to customers through our distribution center in Singapore and a smaller portion within the United States via an operations and distribution center in Irvine, California. Net product revenue derived from actual shipments to international destinations, primarily in Asia represented 95.7%, 96.4% and 96.4% of our net revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales and Marketing</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Our sales and marketing strategy is to achieve design wins with industry leaders by providing quality, state-of-the-art products and superior technical support. We market and sell our products in the United States through a direct sales force, but we also use distributors and manufacturers’ representatives. The majority of our domestic sales occur through our direct sales force, which is located in offices throughout the United States. We market and sell our products internationally through regional offices in Asia and Europe, as well as through a network of independent distributors and representatives in Asia, Australia, Europe, South Africa and South America. We or our customers select these independent entities based largely on their ability to provide effective sales and technical support to our customers. All international sales to date have been in U.S. dollars. We present revenue from independent customers by geographic area in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: left;">Our sales are primarily made through standard purchase orders for delivery of products. We follow industry practice that allows customers to cancel, change or defer orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment. Given this practice, we do not believe that backlog, by itself, is a reliable indicator of future revenue levels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: left;">The semiconductor industry in general, and wired and wireless communications markets in particular, are intensely competitive and are characterized by constant innovation, rapid change, rapid cadence through technology standards, short product life cycles and steady price erosion. We believe that the principal factors of competition for integrated circuit providers in general, or their product offerings in particular, include:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">8</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_009.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li></ul></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">product quality and reputation • market presence</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">product capabilities • standards compliance</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">level of integration • system cost</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">engineering execution and scale • breadth of intellectual property</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">reliability • customer interface and support</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">power efficiency • time-to-market</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">circuit board footprint • security</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We believe that we currently compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits and related applications, including, but not limited to the following:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 130pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Broadband and Connectivity<span class="h1">                                            </span>Infrastructure and Networking</p><ul id="l4"><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Intel Corporation • Cavium, Inc.</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Marvell Technology Group Ltd. • Freescale Semiconductor,Ltd.</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Mediatek Inc. • Intel Corporation</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Qualcomm Incorporation • Marvell Technology Group Ltd.</p></li><li style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -4pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">STMicroelectronics NV • Mellanox</p></li></ul></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: left;">We also compete with suppliers of system-level and motherboard-level solutions incorporating integrated circuits that are proprietary or sourced from manufacturers other than Broadcom. This competition, along with Moore’s law, has resulted and may continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products in certain markets. We also may face competition from newly established competitors, suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies, and customers that choose to develop their own silicon solutions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. Current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties, and may refuse to provide us with information necessary to permit the interoperability of our products with theirs.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. In addition, competitors may develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features, lower power requirements or lower costs. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “<i>Risk Factors</i>” under Item 1A of this Report for further discussion of the risks associated with competition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seasonality</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Our revenue, at both the consolidated and reportable segment level, is subject to some seasonal variation. Our revenue tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year and stronger in the middle of the calendar year. This trend is driven by multiple factors, including manufacturers preparing for the major holiday selling seasons. Our seasonality has varied significantly over time, which ultimately limits the usefulness of this metric as a predictive indicator of our revenue trend on a quarterly basis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intellectual Property</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: left;">Our success and future product revenue growth depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property.

We believe that no single patent is solely responsible for protecting our products and that the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and strategic partners, and typically control access to and distribution of product documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies and processes, develop similar technology independently, or design around our patents. As such, any rights granted under our patents may not provide us with meaningful protection. In addition, we may not be able to successfully enforce our patents against infringing products in every jurisdiction. See “<i>Risk Factors</i>” under Item 1A of this Report for further discussion of the risks associated with patents and intellectual property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some or all of our patents have in the past been licensed and may in the future be licensed to certain of our competitors through cross-license agreements.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Moreover, because we have participated and continue to participate in developing various industry standards, we may be required to license some of our patents to others, including competitors, who develop products based on those standards.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Companies in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the wired and wireless communications markets, often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Broadcom, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our Class A common stock will likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Our quarterly net revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter.

Contributions to our net revenue by these customers have increased in the last several years. Sales to our five largest customers represented 44.1%, 48.3% and 46.9% of our total net revenue in2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Sales to two significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total net revenue, represented 28.2%, 34.6% and 31.9% of our total net revenue in2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total net revenue for the foreseeable future. The loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Also, as our significant customers become larger relative to our business and the industry, they may be able to leverage pricing pressure through the supply chain, vertical integration or other avenues, thereby adversely affecting our gross margins.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: left;">A significant portion of our revenue in any period may also depend on a single product design win with a large customer. As a result, the loss of any such key design win or any significant delay in the ramp of volume production of the customer’s products into which our product is designed could materially and adversely affect our financial</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 116pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">11</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_012.png"/></span></p></body></html>
