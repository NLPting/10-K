Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">3</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Computing and Graphics</p><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The x86 Microprocessor and Chipset Markets</h1><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Central Processing Unit (CPU)<span class="p">. A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer. It generally consists of hundreds of millions or billions of transistors that process data and control other devices in the system, acting as the “brain” of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platforms, such as desktop PCs, notebooks, tablets and workstations. The principal elements used to measure CPU performance are work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU’s internal logic operates, measured in units of gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the number and type of cores in a microprocessor, the bit rating of the microprocessor, memory size and data access speed.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Developments in IC design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">As businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, semiconductor companies are designing and developing multi-core microprocessors, where multiple processor cores are placed on a single die or in a single processor. Multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each of which can execute a task at full speed. Multi- core microprocessors can increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems and lower total cost of ownership.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) and System-on-Chip (SoC)<span class="p">. Consumers increasingly demand computing devices, including desktop and notebooks PCs, and smaller form factors, such as tablets and 2-in-1s (PCs that can function both as a notebook or a tablet), with improved end-user experience, system performance and energy efficiency. Consumers also continue to demand thinner and lighter mobile devices, with better performance and longer battery life. We believe that a computing architecture that optimizes the use of its components can provide these improvements.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">An APU is a processing unit that integrates a CPU and a GPU onto one chip (or one piece of silicon), along with, in some cases, other special-purpose components. This integration enhances system performance by “offloading” selected tasks to the best-suited component (i.e., the CPU or the GPU) to optimize component use, increasing the speed of data flow between the CPU and GPU through shared memory and allowing the GPU to function as both a graphics engine and an application accelerator. Having the CPU and GPU on the same chip also typically improves energy efficiency by, for example, eliminating connections between discrete chips.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">An SoC is a type of IC with a CPU, GPU and other components, such as a memory controller and peripheral management, comprising a complete computing system on a single chip. By combining all of these elements as an SoC, system performance and energy efficiency is improved, similar to an APU.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) describes an industry standard that is an overarching design for having combinations of CPU and GPU processor cores operate as a unified, integrated engine that shares system responsibilities and resources. We are a founding member of the HSA Foundation, a non-profit organization established to define and promote this open standards-based approach to heterogeneous computing. Heterogeneous computing allows for the elevation of the GPU to the same level of the CPU for memory access, queuing and execution. In other words, rather than having a CPU as a master and other various processors as subordinates, these CPU and GPU processing units can be referred to as “compute cores” (where each core is capable of running at least one process in its own context and virtual memory space, independently from other cores). Heterogeneous computing also allows software programmers to develop applications that more fully utilize the full compute capabilities of APUs and SoCs.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">4</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Chipset. <span class="p">A chipset is a generic term referring to a collection of system level components that manage data flow among a microprocessor or microprocessors, memory and peripherals (such as CD ROM drives, DVD drives and USB peripherals). Chipsets perform essential logic functions, balance a system’s performance and provide system control and power management functions. Some chipsets have graphics capabilities by including an integrated graphics processor (IGP) within the chipset. A chipset with an IGP is known as an IGP chipset. IGP chipsets can offer a lower cost, reduced power alternative and are often also used in smaller form factors. Systems that are powered by an APU or by a CPU and discrete GPU combination often do not have a chipset and instead use an AMD Controller Hub chip to perform the functions of a chipset. As a result, we believe that either an APU and AMD Controller Hub chip combination or an SoC, which already includes a chipset, will eventually replace the market for IGP chipsets.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our x86 Microprocessor and Chipset Products</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our microprocessors are incorporated into computing platforms, which are a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete computing solution and to enable and advance the computing components. We believe that integrated, balanced computing platforms consisting of microprocessors, chipsets and GPUs that work together at the system level bring end users improved system stability, increased performance and enhanced power efficiency. In addition, we believe our customers also benefit from an all-AMD platform (consisting of an APU or CPU, a discrete GPU and a chipset or an AMD Fusion Controller Hub chip), as we are able to optimize interoperability, provide them with a single point of contact for the key platform components and enable them to bring the platforms to market faster in a variety of client and server system form factors.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We currently base our microprocessors and chipsets on the x86 instruction set architecture and AMD’s Direct Connect Architecture, which connects an on-chip memory controller and input/output (I/O) channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores. We typically integrate two or more processor cores onto a single die, and each core has its own dedicated cache, which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die, permitting quicker access to frequently used data and instructions. Some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as L2, or second-level cache, and L3, or third-level cache, to enable faster data access and higher performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We focus on continually improving the energy efficiency of our products through our design principles and innovations in power management technology. To that end, we offer CPUs, GPUs, APUs, SoCs and chipsets with multiple low power states that utilize lower clock speeds and voltages to reduce processor power consumption during active and idle times. The use of intelligent, dynamic power management is designed to create lower energy use by allowing compute applications to be completed quickly and efficiently, enabling a return to the ultra- low power idle state.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Desktop. <span class="p">Our APUs for desktop PCs consist primarily of the AMD A-Series and AMD E-Series APUs. We also offer AMD FX CPUs for the enthusiast market. In January 2014, we launched the AMD A10-7850K and A10-7700K, formerly codenamed “Kaveri,” for desktops. “Kaveri” is the world’s first APU to include HSA features, AMD TrueAudio technology for improved fidelity and immersive audio and the HD gaming experience of AMD’s Mantle application programming interface (API). Our Mantle API is designed to allow game developers to take greater advantage of the full capability of our Graphic Core Next (GCN) architecture. Our GCN is our new approach to the design of a consumer GPU. In July 2014, we expanded our desktop AMD A-Series APU with the AMD A10-7800 APU, our high performance APU. We also introduced the AMD A8-7600, AMD A6-7400K and AMD A4-7300 APUs, which are designed to allow consumers to upgrade their application and office experience on their desktop PC. The latest generation of our AMD FX CPUs is based on the “Piledriver” x86 multi-core architecture.

Many consumers value a rich visual experience to enable a more compelling and immersive experience, and, for these consumers, the PC is evolving from a traditional data processing and communications device to an entertainment platform. As a result, visual realism and graphical display capabilities are key product differentiation elements among computing devices. This has led to increasing creation and use of processing- intensive multimedia content for computing devices, including playing games, capturing TV and other multimedia content, viewing online videos, photo editing and managing digital content. In turn, these trends have contributed to higher consumer demand for performance graphics solutions and manufacturers designing computing devices with these capabilities.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our APUs deliver visual processing functionality for value and mainstream PCs by integrating a CPU and a GPU on a single chip, while discrete GPUs (which are also known as dedicated GPUs) are on a separate chip from the CPU and are specifically architected for higher performance graphics processing. Heavy computational workloads have traditionally been processed on a CPU, but we believe that the industry is shifting to a new computing paradigm that increasingly relies more on a discrete GPU or an APU. AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing or GPGPU (General Purpose GPU) refers to a set of advanced hardware and software technologies that enable discrete AMD GPUs, working in concert with the CPU, to accelerate applications beyond traditional graphics and video processing by allowing the discrete GPU and the CPU to process information cooperatively. In addition, computing devices with HSA features run computationally-intensive tasks more efficiently, which we believe provides a superior application experience to the end user.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our Graphics Products</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our graphics products can be found in an APU, GPU, SoC or a combination of a GPU with one of the other foregoing products working in tandem.

These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s:</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">product mix and introduction schedules;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers and channel partners;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">11</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. For example, Intel recently introduced microprocessors for low-cost notebooks, similar to products that we offer for low-cost notebooks.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel’s position in the microprocessor market and IGP chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Other competitors include a variety of companies providing or developing ARM-based designs at relatively low cost and low power processors for the computing market including netbooks, tablets and thin-client form factors, as well as dense servers, set-top boxes and gaming consoles. ARM Holdings designs and licenses its ARM architecture to third parties, including us, and offers supporting software and services. Our ability to compete with companies who use ARM-based solutions depends on our ability to timely design and bring to market energy- efficient, high-performing products at an attractive price point.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In the chipset market, our competitors include suppliers of IGP chipsets. PC manufacturers use IGP chipsets because they cost less than traditional discrete GPUs while offering acceptable graphics performance for most mainstream PC users. Intel also leverages its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its IGP chipsets. Intel manufactures and sells IGP chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is our main competitor in this market.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition in the Graphics Markets</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In the graphics market, our competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics, embedded graphics processors and IGP chipsets. Intel manufactures and sells embedded graphics processors and IGP chipsets, and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. Higher unit shipments of our APUs and Intel’s integrated graphics may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for notebooks, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users, at a lower cost. Intel could take actions that place our discrete GPUs and IGP chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our principal competitor in the graphics market is Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia are the two principal players offering discrete graphics solutions. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market. In the semi-custom game console products, where graphics performance is critical, we compete against primarily Nvidia, and also compete against Imagination Technology Group.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">12</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We focus our research and development activities on improving and enhancing product design. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of products with greater system level integration of the CPU and GPU and transforming our products into SoCs, with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our microprocessors and APU products for notebooks and the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing and gaming and media computing, as well as developing an HSA, which is designed for software developers to easily program APUs by combining scalar processing on the CPU with parallel processing on the GPU, all while providing high bandwidth access to memory at low power. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and we work with others in the industry, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our research and development expenses for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were approximately $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.

Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and maskwork rights. As of December 27, 2014, we had approximately 4,900 patents in the United States and approximately 1,200 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our business.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. One such agreement is the cross license agreement that we entered into with Intel on November 11, 2009. Under the cross license agreement, we granted to Intel and Intel granted to us, non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses to all of each other’s patents that were first filed no later than November 11, 2014 and each party can exploit these patents anywhere in the world for making and selling certain semiconductor- and electronic-related products. Under the cross license agreement, Intel has rights to make semiconductor products for third parties, but the third-party product designs are not licensed as a result of such manufacture. We have rights to perform assembly and testing for third parties but not rights to make semiconductor products for third parties. The term of the cross license agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents, unless earlier terminated. A party can terminate the cross license agreement or the rights and licenses of the other party if the other party materially breaches the cross license agreement and does not correct the noticed material breach within 60 days. Upon such termination, the terminated party’s license rights terminate but the terminating party’s license rights continue, subject to that party’s continued compliance with the terms of the cross license agreement. The cross license agreement will automatically terminate if a party undergoes a change of control (as defined in the cross license agreement), and both parties’ licenses will terminate. Upon the bankruptcy of a party, that party may assume, but may not assign, the cross license agreement, and in the event that the cross license agreement cannot be assumed, the cross license agreement and the licenses granted will terminate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Some of these orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty. Generally, in light of current industry practice, we do not believe that such orders or agreements provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seasonality</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, historically, first quarter PC product sales are generally lower than fourth quarter sales. In addition, with respect to our semi-custom SoC products for game consoles, we expect sales patterns to follow the seasonal trends of a consumer business with sales in the first half of the year being lower than sales in the second half of the year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of December 27, 2014, we had approximately 9,700 employees.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Environmental Regulations</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many aspects of our business operations and products are regulated by domestic and international environmental laws and regulations.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air, water,</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">14</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and requirements with respect to treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. If we fail to comply with any applicable environmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations and/or criminal and civil liabilities. Existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment, to modify product designs or to incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure to adequately control the use, disposal, storage or discharge of hazardous substances could expose us to future liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental requirements and do not expect those requirements to result in material expenditures in the foreseeable future.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions, may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer road maps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Recent U.S. legislation includes disclosure and reporting requirements for companies who use “conflict” minerals that originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We will likely incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the U.S. government. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as “conflict free.” If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor’s products.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits.

Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us.

For example, Intel recently introduced microprocessors for low-cost notebooks, similar to products that we offer for low-cost notebooks.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel could also take actions that place our discrete GPUs at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">16</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel’s position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We rely on GF to manufacture most of our microprocessor and APU products and certain of our GPU and semi-custom products. If GF is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, our business could be adversely impacted.</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements from GF with limited exceptions. If GF is unable to achieve anticipated manufacturing yields, remain competitive using or implementing advanced leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products, manufacture our products on a timely basis at competitive prices or meet our capacity requirements, then we may experience delays in product launches, supply shortages for certain products or increased costs and our business could be materially adversely affected.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Further, if our requirements are less than the number of wafers that we may commit to purchase from GF, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which will adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We are currently in the process of negotiating a fifth amendment to the WSA, and we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material. If we do not successfully conclude our negotiations, it could have a material adverse impact on our gross margin and our results of operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In addition, GF has relied on Mubadala Technology Investments LLC (Mubadala Tech), formerly known as Advanced Technology Investment Company, for its funding needs. If Mubadala Tech fails to adequately fund GF on a timely basis, or at all, GF’s ability to manufacture products for us could be materially adversely affected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected.</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We rely on third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble, test, mark and pack certain of our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We cannot assure you that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. If we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and assemble, test and package products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other users, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">17</p></body></html>
