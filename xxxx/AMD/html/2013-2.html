In March 2012, we acquired SeaMicro, Inc. (SeaMicro), an energy-efficient, high-bandwidth micro-server company, to accelerate our strategy to deliver differentiated micro-server solutions to cloud data centers. In June 2012, we, along with ARM, Imagination Technologies, Media Tek, Qualcomm, Samsung and Texas Instruments established the Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) Foundation, a non-profit consortium established to define and promote an open standards-based approach to heterogeneous computing. In October 2012, we announced that we will design 64-bit ARM<span class="s2">® </span>technology-based processors in addition to our x86 processors for multiple markets, starting with cloud and data center servers. We expect our first ARM technology-based processor will be a highly-integrated, 64-bit multicore system-on-a-chip optimized for the dense, energy-efficient servers. The first ARM technology-based AMD Opteron processor for servers is targeted for production in 2014 and is expected to integrate our AMD SeaMicro Freedom supercompute fabric.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we announced a restructuring plan to improve our cost structure and enhance our competitiveness in core growth areas. This restructuring plan primarily involves a reduction of our global workforce of approximately 14% as well as asset impairments and facility consolidations. We expect the restructuring action will result in operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $190 million in 2013.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Further, to better align with today’s PC market dynamics, we entered into a third amendment to the WSA with GF. Pursuant to the third amendment, we modified our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 under the second amendment to the WSA. In addition, we agreed to certain pricing and other terms applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products to be delivered by GF to us during 2013 and through December 31, 2013. Pursuant to the third amendment, we committed to purchase a fixed number of production wafers at negotiated prices in the fourth quarter of 2012 and through December 31, 2013. GF agreed to waive a portion of our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration of this waiver, we agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million. As a result, we recorded a $273 million LCM charge in the fourth quarter of 2012. The cash impact of this $320 million fee will be spread over several quarters, with $80 million that was paid by December 28, 2012 and $40 million payable by April 1, 2013. For the remainder of the fee, on the same date we entered into the third amendment, we issued a $200 million promissory note to GF that matures on December 31, 2013. Under the third amendment to the WSA, we committed to purchase from GF wafers for approximately $1.15 billion in 2013 and $250 million during the first quarter of 2014. We expect to negotiate the remainder of our 2014 purchase commitments from GF in 2013.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, we continued to focus on executing our engineering milestones. We launched our next AMD A-Series APU, codenamed “Trinity,” and our next generation AMD E-Series APU, codenamed “Brazos 2.0.” We also announced our AMD Z-60 APU, codenamed “Hondo,” our lowest powered APU designed for the performance tablet and small form factor PC market. We launched our AMD Opteron™ 3200, 4300 and 3300 Series server processor platforms based on our next-generation “Piledriver” core architecture. We announced AMD’s SeaMicro SM15000 server chassis, which extends fabric-based computing across racks and aisles of the data center to connect directly to large data storage systems. With respect to our graphics products, we launched our AMD Radeon™ HD 7950 graphics processor, and our AMD Radeon HD 7700 and 7800 series graphics processors, all based on 28nm process technology and designed for enthusiast desktop gamers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GLOBALFOUNDRIES</p><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Formation and Accounting in 2009</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">On March 2, 2009, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement among us, Advanced Technology Investment Company LLC (ATIC), and West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), pursuant to which we formed GF. Based on the structure of the transaction and the guidance on accounting for</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">42</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">interests in variable interest entities, during 2009, GF was deemed a variable-interest entity, and we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Therefore, we consolidated the accounts of GF from March 2, 2009 through December 26, 2009.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">At the Closing, AMD, ATIC and GF also entered into a Shareholders’ Agreement (the Shareholders’ Agreement), a Funding Agreement (the Funding Agreement), and a Wafer Supply Agreement (the WSA).</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Shareholders’ Agreement. <span class="p">The Shareholders’ Agreement set forth the rights and obligations of AMD and ATIC as shareholders of GF. The initial GF board of directors (GF Board) consisted of eight directors, and AMD and ATIC each designated four directors. We were no longer a party to the Shareholders’ Agreement as of March 4, 2012.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Funding Agreement. <span class="p">The Funding Agreement provided for the funding of GF and governed the terms and conditions under which ATIC was obligated to provide such funding. We were no longer a party to the Funding Agreement as of March 4, 2012.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Wafer Supply Agreement. <span class="p">The WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, during 2010, we purchased substantially all of our microprocessor unit (MPU) product requirements from GF. During 2010, we paid GF for wafers on a cost-plus basis. If we acquire a third-party business that manufactures MPU products, we will have up to two years to transition the manufacture of such MPU products to GF.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The WSA terminates no later than March 2, 2024. GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider, and to continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the WSA. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor products will remain as set forth in the WSA, but our purchase commitments to GF will no longer apply. This agreement has been subsequently modified, as disclosed below.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Governance Changes, Funding and Accounting in 2010</h1><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Deconsolidation of GF</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">On December 18, 2009, ATIC International Investment Company (ATIC II) acquired Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. (Chartered). On December 28, 2009, with our consent, ATIC II, Chartered and GF entered into a Management and Operating Agreement (MOA), which provided for the joint management and operation of GF and Chartered, thereby allowing GF and Chartered to share costs, take advantage of operating synergies and market wafer fabrications services on a collective basis. In order to allow for the signing of the MOA on December 28, 2009, prior to obtaining any regulatory approvals, we agreed to irrevocably waive rights under the Shareholders Agreement with respect to certain matters that require unanimous GF Board approval. Additionally, if any such matters came before the GF Board, we agreed that our designated GF directors will vote in the same manner as the majority of ATIC-designated GF Board members voting on any such matters. As a result of waiving such approval rights, as of December 28, 2009, for financial reporting purposes we no longer shared control with ATIC over GF.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities. Based on the results of our evaluation and in light of the governance changes whereby we believed we only had protective rights relative to the operations of GF, we concluded that the other investor in GF, ATIC, was the party who had the power to direct the activities of GF that most significantly impact GF’s performance and was, therefore, the primary beneficiary of GF. Accordingly, effective as of December 27, 2009, we deconsolidated GF, and during 2010 we accounted for our ownership interest in GF under the equity method of accounting. For purposes of our application of the equity method of accounting during 2010, we recorded our share of GF’s results excluding the results of Chartered because GF did not have an equity ownership interest in Chartered. The terms of the Funding Agreement and the WSA described above were not affected by the deconsolidation of GF. Following the deconsolidation, GF became our related party.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">43</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Funding of GF</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">During 2010, ATIC contributed $930 million of cash to GF. We did not participate in the funding. These contributions resulted in an aggregate gain on our ownership interest of $232 million, which we recorded as part of the equity in net loss of investee line item on our consolidated statement of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Contribution Agreement, Funding and Accounting in 2011</h1><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GLOBALFOUNDRIES Singapore Pte. Ltd. (GFS, formerly Chartered) Contribution in 2011</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">On December 27, 2010, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, ATIC International Investment Company LLC, an affiliate of ATIC, contributed all of the outstanding Ordinary Shares of GFS to GF. As the result of dilution of our ownership in GF, during the first quarter of 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized a non-cash gain of approximately $492 million, net of certain transaction related charges, in Equity income (loss) and dilution gain in investee, net.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Following the GFS contribution and governance changes described above, we assessed our ability to exercise significant influence over GF and considered factors such as our representation on GF’s board of directors, participation in GF’s policy-making processes, material intra- entity transactions, interchange of managerial personnel, technological dependency, and the extent of our ownership in relation to ownership by the other shareholders. Based on the results of our assessment, we concluded that we no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over GF. Accordingly, as of the first quarter of 2011, we changed our method of accounting for our ownership interest in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Under the cost method of accounting, we no longer recognized any share of GF’s net income or loss in our consolidated statement of operations. In addition, we reviewed the carrying value of our investment in GF for impairment at each reporting period. Impairment indicators, among other factors, include significant deterioration in GF’s earnings performance or business prospects, significant changes in the market conditions in which GF operates, and GF’s ability to continue as a going concern.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Impairment of Investment in GF</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">During the fourth quarter of 2011, we identified indicators of impairment, including revised financial projections which we received from GF. The fair value of our GF investment was determined by a valuation analysis of GF’s Class A Preferred Shares, utilizing the revised financial projections. We concluded the decline in fair value was other than temporary. As a result of the valuation analysis, we recorded a non- cash impairment charge of approximately $209 million, based on the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the investment as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, our investment balance in GF after impairment was $278 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amended Wafer Supply Agreement</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">On April 2, 2011, we entered into a first amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the first amendment was to change the pricing methodology applicable to wafers delivered in 2011 for our microprocessors, including APU products. The first amendment also modified our existing commitments regarding the production of certain GPU and chipset products at GF. Pursuant to the first amendment, GF committed to provide us with, and we committed to purchase, a fixed number of 45nm and 32nm wafers per quarter in 2011. We paid GF a fixed price for 45nm wafers delivered in 2011. Our price for 32nm wafers varied based on the wafer volumes and manufacturing yield of such wafers and was based on good die. In addition, we also agreed to pay an additional quarterly amount to GF during 2012 totaling up to $430 million if GF met specified conditions related to the continued availability of 32nm capacity as of the beginning of 2012. As part of the second amendment described below, GF agreed to waive these quarterly payments, and therefore we are no longer required to pay them.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">44</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amendments to Wafer Supply Agreement and Accounting in 2012</h1><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Second Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">On March 4, 2012, we entered into a second amendment to the WSA with GF. The primary effect of this second amendment was to modify certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products to be delivered by GF to us during 2012. Pursuant to the second amendment, GF committed to provide us with, and we committed to purchase, a fixed number of production wafers in 2012. We paid GF fixed prices for production wafers delivered in 2012.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The second amendment also granted us certain rights to contract with another wafer foundry supplier with respect to specified 28 nm products for a specified period of time. In consideration for these rights, we agreed to pay GF $425 million and transfer to GF all of the capital stock of GF that we owned. As a result of us receiving these rights in the first quarter of 2012, we recorded a charge related to this limited waiver of exclusivity from GF of $703 million consisting of the $425 million cash payment and a $278 million non-cash charge representing the carrying and fair value of the capital stock that we transferred to GF. Pursuant to the second amendment, $150 million of the $425 million was paid on March 5, 2012, $50 million was paid on June 29, 2012 and $50 million was paid on October 1, 2012 with the remaining $175 million paid by December 31, 2012. In addition, as security for the final two payments, we issued a $225 million promissory note to GF.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">As a result of the transfer of our shares of GF capital stock, we no longer owned any GF capital stock. Also, we are no longer entitled to designate a director to GF’s board, and our designated director resigned effective as of the date of the second amendment. As of March 4, 2012, we were no longer a party to either the Shareholders’ Agreement or the Funding Agreement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Third Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">On December 6, 2012, we entered into a third amendment to the WSA with GF. Pursuant to the third amendment, we modified our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 under the second amendment to the WSA. In addition, we agreed to certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products to be delivered by GF to us during 2013 and through December 31, 2013. Pursuant to the third amendment, we committed to purchase a fixed number of production wafers at negotiated prices in the fourth quarter of 2012 and through December 31, 2013. GF agreed to waive a portion of our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration of this waiver, we agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million. As a result, we recorded an LCM charge of $273 million for the write-down of inventory to its market value in the fourth quarter of 2012. The cash impact of this $320 million fee will be spread over several quarters, with $80 million paid by December 28, 2012 and $40 million by April 1, 2013. For the remainder of the fee, we issued a</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">$200 million promissory note to GF that matures on December 31, 2013.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">GF continues to be a related party of AMD. Our expenses related to GF’s wafer manufacturing were $1.2 billion, $904 million and $1.2 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Our expenses related to GF’s research and development activities were $49 million, $79 million and $114 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Critical Accounting Estimates</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, asset impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">45</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Revenue Allowances. <span class="p">We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, allowances, historical price reductions, market activity, and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment, and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Inventory Valuation. <span class="p">At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. In addition, we write off inventories that are considered obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and market value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Goodwill. <span class="p">Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We perform the annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value and, if so, by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. The implied fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the application of one or more valuation models common to our industry, including the income, market and cost approaches. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we believe that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units, discounted using estimated discount rates. The key assumptions we have used to determine the fair value of our reporting units includes projected cash flows for the next 10 years and discount rates ranging from 15% to 30%. Discount rates are based on our weighted-average cost of capital, adjusted for the risks associated with operations. A variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded, if any.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Based on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2012 and 2011, each reporting unit’s fair values exceeded their carrying values, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">For the annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2012, each reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value ranging from approximately 6% to approximately 170%. The estimated fair value of our Computing Solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6%. Total goodwill relating to our Computing Solutions reporting unit was $230 million as of December 29, 2012. The reasons for the small excess of fair value over carrying value of the Computing Solutions reporting unit are primarily due to the recent global economic downturn, the changes in our industry, specifically related to the decline in PC sales, and the decline in our market capitalization. Estimates of fair value for all of our reporting units can be affected by a</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">46</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">variety of external and internal factors. Potential events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our Computing Solutions reporting unit include adverse changes in our industry, increased competition, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecasts, and further decline in our stock price. If the estimated fair value of our Computing Solutions reporting unit declines due to any of these factors, we may be required to record future goodwill impairment charges.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Income Taxes. <span class="p">In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Results of Operations</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses our operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net and income taxes. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We use the following two reportable operating segments:</p><ul id="l1"><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the Computing Solutions segment, which includes microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated as an APU, chipsets and embedded processors; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the Graphics segment, which includes graphics, video and multimedia products developed for use in desktop and notebook computers, including home media PCs, professional workstations and servers as well as revenue received in connection with the development and sale of game console systems that incorporate our graphics technology.</p></li></ul><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In addition to these reportable segments, we have an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category includes certain expenses and credits that were not allocated to any of the operating segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the operating segments. Also included in this category are amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock- based compensation expense, restructuring charges and a charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">47</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We use a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending last Saturday in December.

2011 as a result of a 14% decrease in unit shipments and a 7% decrease in average selling price. Unit shipments of all categories of products decreased. The decrease in the average selling price was primarily attributable to a decrease in average selling price of our microprocessors for desktop PCs and servers. Unit shipments and average selling price of our microprocessors for desktop PCs decreased due to challenging market conditions and the increasing popularity of tablets as a consumer device of choice, which resulted in decreased demand for our products. Unit shipments and average selling price of our microprocessors for servers decreased primarily due to challenging market conditions.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Computing Solutions net revenue of $5.0 billion in 2011 increased 4% compared to net revenue of $4.8 billion in 2010, primarily as a result of a 16% increase in unit shipments partially offset by an 11% decrease in average selling price. The increase in unit shipments was attributable to an increase in unit shipments of our microprocessors, including APU products for mobile devices, as well as our chipset products. Unit shipments of our microprocessors, including APU products for mobile devices increased due to strong demand for our Brazos and Llano-based APU platforms. However, the increase in unit shipments in 2011 was limited by supply constraints with respect to certain microprocessor products manufactured using the 32nm technology node. Chipset unit shipments increased primarily due to an increase in overall unit shipments of our microprocessor products. The decrease in overall average selling price was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average selling price of our microprocessors for servers due to a shift in our product mix and competitive market conditions as well as sales of our Brazos APU platforms, which have a lower average selling price than our other processor products.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">48</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Computing Solutions operating loss was $231 million in 2012 compared to operating income of $556 million in 2011. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $136 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses, a $45 million decrease in research and development expenses and a $29 million decrease in cost of sales. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower unit shipments, partially offset by the $273 million LCM charge related to the fee for GF’s waiver of a portion of our obligations and an inventory write-down of $100 million during the third quarter of 2012 as a result of lower than anticipated future demand for certain products, mainly first generation A-Series APU products, codenamed “Llano”.

Net revenue from sales of GPU products decreased due to lower unit shipments, partially offset by increased average selling price. GPU unit shipments decreased due to challenging market conditions. GPU average selling price increased primarily due to improved product mix.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Graphics net revenue of $1.6 billion in 2011 decreased by 6% compared to net revenue of $1.7 billion in 2010. The decrease was due primarily to a 6% decrease in net revenue from sales of GPU products. Net revenue from sales of GPU products decreased primarily due to a decrease in both GPU unit shipments and average selling price. The decrease in GPU unit shipments was primarily due to lower customer demand, which we believe was due in part to the disruption in the supply of hard disk drives caused by the flooding in Thailand at the beginning of 2011. GPU average selling price decreased due to a shift in our product mix to lower-end GPU products.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Graphics operating income was $105 million in 2012 compared to $51 million in 2011. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to a $101 million decrease in cost of sales, a $60 million decrease in research and development expenses and a $41 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses partially offset by the decrease in net revenue referenced above. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower GPU shipments and correspondingly lower manufacturing costs.

The decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in net revenue referenced above and a $20 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $25 million decrease in cost of sales. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses,” below.

Pursuant to this agreement, all claims between the parties were dismissed with prejudice and Samsung agreed to pay us $283 million less any withholding taxes. We received the first payment of $119 million (which represents $143 million less withholding taxes) in December 2010. The remaining amount of $117 million (which represents $140 million less withholding taxes) was paid in two equal installments in May 2011 and in November 2011. In addition, pursuant to the settlement agreement, Samsung granted us, and we granted to Samsung, non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses to all patents and patent applications for ten years after the effective date of the Agreement to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise dispose of certain semiconductor- and electronic-related products anywhere in the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">This settlement encompassed all patent litigation and disputes between the parties.

The plan primarily involves a workforce reduction of approximately 14% as well as asset impairments and facility consolidations. We recorded restructuring expense in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately $90 million. Substantially all of the restructuring expense is related to severance. Of the total restructuring expense, approximately $46 million related to cash payments in the fourth quarter of 2012, with the remaining $41 million related to anticipated cash payments in 2013. The non-cash portion of the restructuring expense included approximately $4 million of asset impairments. We plan to substantially complete the plan by the end of the first quarter of 2013.

The plan included a workforce reduction of approximately 13% and contract and program terminations. We recorded a $100 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2011 and an additional $8 million restructuring charge in 2012, which consisted of $62 million for severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, $46 million for contract or program termination costs and $1 million for asset impairments.

In 2011, we reversed approximately $2 million of costs associated with the 2008 restructuring plan because the actual restoration costs for vacated facilities were lower than previously estimated. In 2010, we reversed approximately $4 million of costs associated with the 2008 restructuring plan because the actual severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits were lower than previously estimated.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The following table provides a summary of each major type of

8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Stock-based compensation expense of $97 million in 2012 increased by $7 million as compared to $90 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to the additional expense related to the equity grants made in connection with our acquisition of SeaMicro and an increase in the number of employee stock options and restricted stock units that we granted, partially offset by the absence of a charge related to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">the acceleration of vesting of all unvested equity incentive awards held by our former Chief Executive Officer in the first quarter of 2011 as a result of his resignation from AMD, effective January 10, 2011 and a lower weighted-average estimated grant date fair value in 2012 as compared to 2011.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Stock-based compensation expenses of $90 million in 2011 increased $3 million compared to $87 million in 2010. This increase was primarily due to the acceleration of vesting of all unvested equity awards held by our former Chief Executive Officer in the first quarter of 2011 as a result of his resignation from AMD, effective January 10, 2011, and an increase in the number of employee stock options and restricted stock units that we granted in 2011 compared to 2010, partially offset by a lower weighted-average estimated grant date fair value in 2011 as compared to 2010.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">As of December 29, 2012, we had $44 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options that will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 2.20 years. Also, as of December 29, 2012, we had $97 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock and restricted stock units that will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 1.97 years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International Sales</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 92% in 2012, 93% in 2011, and 88% in 2010. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future.

During 2012, we made net cash payments of $281 million to acquire SeaMicro, $250 million related to the limited waiver of exclusively from GF, $105 million related to restructuring activities and $80 million related to GF’s waiver of a portion of our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. The percentage of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the United States was 94% as of December 29, 2012.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">During 2012, we invested an additional $32 million in long-term marketable securities, which we intend to hold for more than one year and do not intend to use in current operations. Our long-term marketable securities are invested in corporate bonds and money market funds that have maximum stated maturities of 2 years. As of December 29, 2012, the fair value of these long-term marketable securities was $181 million. All of the long-term marketable securities were held in the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">As of December 29, 2012, our debt and capital lease obligations were $2.04 billion, which reflects a debt discount adjustment of $60 million on our 6.00% Notes and 8.125% Senior Notes due 2017 (8.125% Notes). In the third quarter of 2012, we repaid in full the outstanding principal and accrued interest on our 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 (5.75% Notes), of approximately $499 million, and issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes).</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">For 2012, our net cash used in operating activities was $338 million and our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was negative $471 million. Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure, which we calculated in 2012 by taking GAAP net cash used in operating activities of</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">$338 million for 2012 and subtracting capital expenditures, which were $133 million for 2012. For 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $382 million and our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $528 million. For 2011, we calculated non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow by taking GAAP net cash provided by operating activities of $382 million for 2011 and adding $396 million, which represented payments made by certain of our distributor customers during 2011 to IBM Credit LLC and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the IBM Parties) pursuant to our former accounts receivable financing arrangement, which we describe in further detail below. Then we adjusted the resulting amount of $778 million by subtracting capital expenditures, which were $250 million for 2011. Compared to our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of $528 million for 2011, the decrease in our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow for 2012 was primarily due to the fact that we did not generate cash flow from operating activities in 2012; instead we used $338 million of net cash for operating activities. The decrease was partially offset by a $117 million decrease in capital expenditures.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We had various supplier agreements with the IBM Parties pursuant to which we sold invoices of selected distributor customers. Under this financing arrangement, we did not recognize revenue until our distributors sold our products to their customers. Under GAAP, we classified funds received from the IBM Parties as debt on the balance sheet. Moreover, for cash flow purposes, we classified these funds as cash flows from financing activities. When a distributor paid the applicable IBM Party, we reduced the distributor’s accounts receivable and the corresponding debt resulted in a non-cash accounting entry. Because we did not receive the cash from the distributor to reduce the accounts receivable, the distributor’s payment was not reflected in our cash flows from operating activities.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Generally, under GAAP, the reduction in accounts receivable is assumed to be a source of operating cash flow. Therefore, we believe that treating the payments from our distributor customers to the IBM Parties as if we actually received the cash from the distributor and then used that cash to pay down the debt to the IBM Parties was more reflective of the economic substance of the financing arrangement with the IBM Parties. We terminated our financing arrangement with the IBM Parties in February 2011. Commencing in the third quarter of 2011, we no longer make the adjustment for distributors’ payments to the IBM Parties to our GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities when calculating our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">56</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We calculate and communicate adjusted free cash flow because our management believes it is important for investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. Our calculation of adjusted free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view adjusted free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating or financing activities.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We believe that the challenging macroeconomic conditions that we experienced in the second half of 2012 will continue during the first half of 2013. In light of the macroeconomic environment, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our operating expenses and better position us competitively. With our restructuring and available external financing, we believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures over the next twelve months.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We believe that in the event we decide to obtain external funding, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms favorable to us or at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Over the longer term, should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. We cannot assure you that macroeconomic conditions will improve, and they could worsen. If market conditions do not improve or deteriorate, we may be limited in our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Auction Rate Securities</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">As a result of the uncertainties in the credit markets, all of our auction rate securities (ARS) were negatively affected, and since February 2008, auctions for these securities failed to settle on their respective settlement dates. However, there have been no defaults, and we have received all interest payments as they became due.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">During 2012, we did not realize any gain or loss on sales of available-for-sale securities of approximately $6 million, and we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $4 million during the fourth quarter.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">As of December 29, 2012, the par value of our ARS was $37 million, with an estimated fair value of $28 million. Total ARS, at fair value, represented 3% of our total investment portfolio as of December 29, 2012.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Based on the recent tender and redemption activities and the fact that the secondary market for these securities has become more liquid, with pricing generally similar to our carrying value, we classified these securities as marketable securities as of December 29, 2012. We have the intent and believe we have the ability to sell these securities within the next 12 months. During the first quarter to date, we sold $13 million of our ARS for an insignificant loss.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Operating Activities</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Net cash used in operating activities was $338 million in 2012. A net loss of $1,183 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of a $278 million charge related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF, $260 million of depreciation and amortization expense,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">$97 million of stock-based compensation expense and $23 million of non-cash interest expense related to our 6.00% Notes and 8.125% Notes. These charges were partially offset by a benefit of $40 million for deferred income taxes.

During 2012, our payable to GF, which included all amounts that we owe to GF, increased by $277 million. The increase was due to cash obligations of $240 million related to the third amendment to the WSA and</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">$175 million related to the limited waiver of exclusivity from GF, offset by a decrease of $138 million in the amount of billings related to wafer purchases. Accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other decreased by $232 million primarily due to a $94 million decrease in accrued liabilities, a $92 million decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities, a $23 million decrease in other liabilities, a $15 million decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors and a $6 million decrease in accrued compensation and benefits.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Net cash provided by operating activities was $382 million in 2011. Net income of $491 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $317 million of depreciation and amortization expense, a $209 million impairment charge on our investment in GF, $90 million of stock based compensation expense, and $21 million of non-cash interest expense related to our 6.00% Notes and our 8.125% Notes. These charges were partially offset by recognition of a non-cash gain of $492 million due to the dilution of our equity interest in GF. The net changes in operating assets at December 31, 2011 compared to December 25, 2010 included an increase in accounts receivable of $347 million, which included the non-cash impact of our previous financing arrangements with the IBM Parties. During 2011, the IBM Parties collected approximately $396 million from our distributor customers pursuant to these arrangements. Without considering the collection by the IBM Parties of the accounts receivables that we sold to them, our accounts receivable decreased $49 million. This decrease was primarily due to timing of sales and collections during 2011. There was also a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $115 million primarily due to the receipt of the final settlement payment from Samsung of $117 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Net cash used in operating activities was $412 million in 2010. Net income of $471 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of a $462 million loss from the application of the equity method of accounting for our investment in GF, $383 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $87 million of stock-based compensation expense, $30 million of interest expense related to our 6.00% Notes and our 8.125% Notes and a $24 million net loss related to our repurchase of an aggregate of $1,016 million principal amount of our 6.00% Notes for $1,011 million in cash. These charges were partially offset by a non-cash gain of $325 million related to the deconsolidation of GF, amortization of foreign grants of $16 million and a net gain of $17 million from the sale of marketable securities. The net changes in operating assets at December 25, 2010 compared to December 26, 2009 included an increase in accounts receivable of $1,138 million, which included the non-cash impact of our financing arrangement with the IBM Parties. During 2010, the IBM Parties collected approximately $915 million from our distributor customers pursuant to these arrangements. Without considering the collection by the IBM Parties of the accounts receivables that we sold to them, our accounts receivable increased $223 million. This increase was primarily due to the introduction and sale of new products towards the end of 2010 and the timing of the related collections. Excluding the effects of the deconsolidation of GF, there was also a decrease in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other of $184 million, primarily due to the timing of payments. Accounts payable to GF increased by $55 million due to the timing of payments during 2010.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investing Activities</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Net cash used in investing activities was $19 million in 2012.

In addition, we had a net cash outflow of $147 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment and of $160 million for purchases of available-for-sale securities.

Also excluded from other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above was $2 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in the caption “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet at December 29, 2012. This amount represents a potential cash payment that could be payable by us upon settlement with a taxing authority.

As security for a portion of the payment, we issued a $225 million promissory note to GF. As of December 29, 2012, the outstanding balance under this promissory note was $175 million.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Interest Rate Risk. <span class="p">Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 29, 2012, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, ARS, and corporate bonds. With the exception of our ARS, these investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">As of December 29, 2012, all of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Default Risk. <span class="p">We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in debt and marketable equity securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 29, 2012, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">As a result of the uncertainties in the credit markets, all of our ARS were negatively affected and auctions for these securities failed to settle on their respective settlement dates since February 2008. As of December 29, 2012, the par value of our ARS was $37 million, with an estimated fair value of $28 million.

We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">During the first quarter of 2011, we reassessed our hedging needs related to our Euro foreign exchange contracts and liquidated our Euro currency forward contracts. As a result, during 2011, we recorded a gain of $6 million in other income (expense), net, in our consolidated statement of operations. We may economically hedge any material Euro exposure by entering into Euro currency forward contracts we identify in the future.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries, primarily those denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">65</p></body></html>
