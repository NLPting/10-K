An integrated circuit, or IC, is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost per function. In order to satisfy the demand for faster, smaller and lower-cost ICs, semiconductor companies have continually developed improvements in manufacturing and process technology and design. ICs are increasingly being manufactured using smaller geometries on larger silicon wafers. Use of smaller process geometries can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and cost less to manufacture on a per unit basis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Computing Solutions</p><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -22pt;line-height: 151%;text-align: left;">The x86 Microprocessor Market Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h1><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the central processing unit, or CPU, of a computer. It generally consists of millions of transistors that process data and control other devices in the system, acting as the brain of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of a computer and numerous other electronic systems. The principal indicators of CPU performance are work-per-cycle, or how many instructions are executed per cycle, clock speed, representing the rate at which a CPUs internal logic operates, measured in units of hertz, or cycles per second, and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the number of CPUs, or cores, on a microprocessor, the bit rating of the microprocessor, memory size and data access speed.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Developments in circuit design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Currently, microprocessors are designed to process 32-bits or 64-bits of information at one time. The bit rating of a microprocessor generally denotes the largest size of numerical data that a microprocessor can handle. Microprocessors with 64-bit processing capabilities enable systems to have greater performance by allowing software applications and operating systems to access more memory.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">2</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">®</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">® ® ®</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Moreover, as businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, semiconductor companies are designing and developing multi-core microprocessors, where multiple processor cores are placed on a single die or in a single processor. Multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores each of which can execute a task at full speed. Moreover, multiple processor cores packaged together can increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. This type of “symmetrical multiprocessing” is effective in both multi- tasking environments where multiple cores can enable operating systems to prioritize and manage tasks from multiple software applications simultaneously and also for “multi-threaded” software applications where multiple cores can process different parts of the software program, or “threads,” simultaneously thereby enhancing performance of the application. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which allows them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems thereby reducing the total cost of ownership.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Accelerated Processing Unit (APU)</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">While general purpose computer architectures based on the x86 architecture are sufficient for many customers, we believe that an architecture that optimizes the use of a CPU and graphics processing unit, or GPU, for a given workload can provide a substantial improvement in user experience, performance and energy efficiency. As the volume of digital media increases, we believe many customers can benefit from an accelerated computing architecture. An accelerated computing architecture enables “offloading” of selected tasks, thereby optimizing the use of multiple computational units such as the CPU and GPU, depending on the application or workload. For example, serial workloads are better suited for CPUs, while highly parallel tasks may be better performed by a GPU. Our AMD Accelerated Processing Unit, or APU, combines our CPU and GPU onto a single piece of silicon. We believe that high performance computing workloads, workloads that are visual in nature and even traditional applications such as photo and video editing or other multi-media applications can benefit from our accelerated computing architecture.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Microprocessor Products (CPUs and APUs)</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We currently design, develop and sell microprocessor products for servers, desktop PCs and mobile devices, including mobile PCs and tablets. Our microprocessors and chipsets are incorporated into computing platforms that also include GPUs and core software to enable and advance the computing components. A platform is a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete computing solution. We believe that integrated, balanced platforms consisting of microprocessors, chipsets and GPUs that work together at the system level bring end users improved system stability, increased performance and enhanced power efficiency. Furthermore, by combining all of these elements onto a single piece of silicon as an APU, we believe system performance and power efficiency is further improved. In addition to the enhancements at the end-user level, our customers also benefit from an all-AMD platform, as we are able to provide them with a single point of contact for the key platform components and enable them to bring the platforms to market faster in a variety of client and server system form factors.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our CPUs and APUs are manufactured primarily using 45-nanometer (nm), 40nm, and 32nm process technology. We currently base our microprocessors and chipsets on the x86 instruction set architecture and AMD’s Direct Connect Architecture, which connects an on-chip memory controller and input/output, or I/O, channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores. We typically integrate two or more processor cores onto a single die, and each core has its own dedicated cache, which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die, permitting quicker access to frequently used data and instructions. Some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as L2, or second level cache, and L3, or third level cache, to enable faster data access and higher performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Energy efficiency and power consumption continue to be key design principles for our products. We focus on continually improving power management technology, or “performance-per-watt.” To that end, we offer CPUs, APUs and chipsets with features that we have designed to reduce system level energy consumption, with multiple levels of lower clock speed and voltage states that reduce processor power consumption during idle times. We design our CPUs and APUs to be compatible with operating system software such as the Microsoft<span class="s6">® </span>Windows<span class="s6">® </span>family of operating systems, Linux<span class="s6">®</span>, NetWare<span class="s6">®</span>, Solaris and UNIX. Our CPUs and chipsets support multiple generations of HyperTransport™ technology, which is a high-bandwidth communications interface that enables higher levels of multi-processor performance and scalability over traditional front side bus-based microprocessor technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our AMD family of APUs represents a new approach to processor design and software development, delivering serial, parallel and visual compute capabilities for HD video, 3D and data-intensive workloads in the APU. APUs combine high-performance serial and parallel processing cores with other special-purpose hardware accelerators. We design our APUs for improved visual computing, security, performance- per-watt and smaller device form factors. Having the CPU and GPU on the same chip reduces the system power and bill-of-materials, speeds the flow of data between the CPU and GPU through shared memory and allows the GPU to function as both a graphic engine and an application accelerator in high efficient compute platforms.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">3</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Building on the integration of our CPU and GPU onto a single piece of silicon, we are focused on evolving our accelerated computing architecture in such a manner so that software programmers see a single multi-purpose processing unit. Heterogeneous Systems Architecture describes our overarching design for having combinations of CPU and GPU processor cores operate as a unified engine that we intend to be both higher performance and lower power than our previous architectures.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Server. <span class="p">A server is a system that performs services for connected clients as part of a client-server architecture. Servers are designed to run an application or applications, often for extended periods of time with minimal human direction. Examples of servers include web servers, e- mail servers, print servers and cloud computing servers. These servers run a variety of applications including business intelligence, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and advanced scientific or engineering models commonly referred to as high performance computing, or HPC. HPC involves the use of supercomputers and computer clusters to solve advanced computational problems in disciplines ranging from financial modeling to weather forecasting to oil and gas exploration. Cloud computing is a computing model where data, applications and services are delivered over the internet or an intranet.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In November 2011, we launched the AMD Opteron™ 6200 series processor, codenamed “Interlagos,” and AMD Opteron 4200 series processor, codenamed “Valencia,” our latest generation of microprocessors for server platforms that consist of 8-, 12- and 16-core versions and are based on our x86 “Bulldozer” architecture. These new processors are designed to specifically enhance the scalability of enterprise applications while enabling Web and database center customers to better handle emerging cloud and virtualization workloads. Virtualization is the use of software to allow multiple discrete operating systems and application environments (i.e., multiple virtual servers) to share a single physical computer. By enabling multiple operating systems and applications to run on the same server, virtualization offers the benefit of consolidating workloads and reducing hardware requirements, which can also reduce power, cooling and system management costs. We designed the AMD Opteron 6200 series processor to handle multi-threaded workloads, such as cloud computing, virtualization, HPC, databases and business application. We designed the AMD Opteron 4200 series processor to handle demanding server workloads at the lowest possible energy consumption, which we believe is well suited for power-conscious cloud deployments and for IT infrastructure and collaboration.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In February 2011, we introduced five new members of the AMD Opteron 6100 Series platform designed to address the demand for low- power, balanced systems for small and medium businesses and increased performance-per-dollar-per-watt for enterprise and public sector environments.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Mobile Devices. <span class="p">Consumers continue to demand thinner and lighter mobile platforms with better entertainment performance and longer battery life. In response to this demand, we continue to invest in designing and developing higher performing and low power mobile platforms. Our APUs for mobile PC platforms consist of our performance, mainstream A-Series APU, codenamed “Llano,” that we launched in July 2011, the E-Series APU for mainstream, everyday performance, codenamed “Zacate,” that we launched in January 2011, the C-Series APU for HD internet experiences in small form factors, codenamed “Ontario,” that we also launched in January 2011 and the Z–Series APU for Windows- based tablets, codenamed “Desna,” that we launched in June 2011.

Other requirements include advanced specifications for industrial temperatures, shock and vibration, and reliability.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our embedded platforms include options from the AMD Opteron, AMD Athlon, AMD Turion, and AMD Sempron processor families; the AMD Embedded G-Series, which is the embedded version of our APUs; the AMD Radeon™ graphics processor family; and numerous AMD chipsets. These products are part of the AMD Longevity Program, which provides for an availability period of up to five years in some cases in order to support lengthy development and qualification cycles and long-term life of the system in the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In May 2011, we announced two additional AMD Embedded G-Series APUs. These low-power processors are designed for compact, fanless embedded systems like digital signage, kiosks, and mobile industrial devices. Also in May 2011, we introduced the AMD Radeon E6760 embedded discrete graphics processor, which offers embedded system designers the combination of OpenCL™, and AMD Eyefinity- enhanced support. OpenCL, or Open Computing Language, is the programming standard for general-purpose computations on systems that use more than one kind of processor, such as an APU. AMD Eyefinity is a technology that allows a game to be played across multiple screens in a panoramic view with minimal distortion by allowing up to six monitors to be connected to one graphics processor.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chipset Market and Products</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Chipsets send data between the microprocessor and input, display and storage devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drive and CD or DVD drive. Chipsets perform essential logic functions, such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks. Chipsets also extend the graphics, audio, video and other capabilities of computer systems. All desktop and mobile PCs as well as servers incorporate a chipset. In many PCs, the chipset is integrated with additional functions such as a GPU. An integrated chipset solution is commonly known as an integrated graphics processor, or IGP, chipset. Chipsets that do not integrate a graphics core are connected to what is known as a discrete GPU. IGP chipsets offer a lower cost solution and in some circumstances can offer reduced power consumption or smaller system form factors. A majority of PCs make use of IGP chipsets, while discrete GPUs are used in higher performance PCs and servers. Our APU architecture replaces an IGP-type chipset with an AMD Fusion Controller Hub chip which performs the input and output functions of the chipset. We believe that the combination of an APU and the AMD Fusion Controller Hub will eventually replace our market for IGP chipsets.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In June 2011, we launched our 9-Series Chipsets designed to help our customers develop next generation high performance desktop platforms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Graphics</p><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Graphics Market</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The primary product of a semiconductor graphics supplier is the GPU. The GPU is specifically architected for high performance graphics processing, unlike the CPU. In this way, a dedicated GPU and CPU work in tandem to increase overall speed and performance of the system. A graphics solution can be in the form of either a discrete GPU, an integrated chipset, an embedded graphics processor or a combination of the discrete GPU and integrated/embedded solution working in tandem. The semiconductor graphics market addresses the need for visual or parallel processing in various computing and entertainment platforms such as desktop PCs, mobile PCs and workstations. Users of these products value a rich visual experience, particularly in the high-end enthusiast market where consumers often seek out the fastest and highest performing visual processing products to enable the most compelling and immersive gaming experiences. Moreover, for many consumers, the PC is evolving from a traditional data and communications processing machine to an entertainment platform. Visual realism and graphical display capabilities are key elements of product differentiation among various product platforms. This has led to the increasing creation and use of processing intensive multimedia content for PCs and to PC manufacturers designing PCs for playing games, displaying photos and capturing TV and other multimedia content, viewing online videos, photo editing and managing digital content. In turn, the trend has contributed to the development of higher performance graphics solutions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Graphics Products</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our customers generally use our graphics solutions to increase the speed of rendering images and to improve image resolution and color definition. We develop our products for use in desktop and mobile PCs, professional workstations, servers and gaming consoles. With each of our graphics products, we provide drivers and supporting software packages that enable the effective use of these products under a variety of operating systems and applications. In addition, our recent generation graphics products have Linux<span class="s6">® </span>driver support.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">5</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Heavy computational workloads have traditionally been processed on a CPU, but we believe that the industry is shifting to a new computing paradigm that increasingly relies more on the GPU or a combination of GPU and CPU. AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing or GPGPU (General Purpose GPU) refers to a set of advanced hardware and software technologies that enable AMD GPUs, working in concert with the computer system’s CPUs, to accelerate applications beyond traditional graphics and video processing by allowing the CPUs and GPUs to process information cooperatively. Heterogeneous computing enables PCs and servers to run computationally-intensive tasks more efficiently, providing a superior application experience to the end user.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our APU is a heterogeneous system that incorporates Microsoft<span class="s6">® </span>DirectX<span class="s6">® </span>11 (DirectX 11) discrete level GPU capabilities for graphics processing and other mathematically intensive computations on very large data sets, to handle visual tasks such as 3D rendering as well as certain fixed functions. The APU continues to utilize a CPU to run the operating system and most traditional PC applications. With our APUs, we offer discrete level GPU performance at value and mainstream price points with the added benefit of long battery life in mobile PCs and lower power computing devices. Additionally, a mainstream APU, when paired with an AMD discrete GPU, in multi-GPU configuration will enable greater graphics performance and parallel processing. We believe that high performance computing workloads, workloads that are visual in nature and even traditional applications such as photo and video editing or other multi-media applications can benefit from our accelerated computing architecture.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Discrete Desktop Graphics. <span class="p">We believe that discrete graphic solutions will continue to be popular across desktop PC configurations and platforms designed for gaming, multimedia, photo and video editing as well as other graphic-intensive applications.

Products typically compete on product quality, power consumption (including battery life), reliability, speed, performance, size (or form factor), cost, selling price, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), software and hardware compatibility and stability, brand recognition, timely product introductions and availability. Technological advances in the industry result in frequent product introductions, regular price reductions, short product life cycles and increased product capabilities that may result in significant performance improvements. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to develop, introduce and sell new products or enhanced versions of existing products on a timely basis and at competitive prices, while reducing our costs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition in the Microprocessor Market</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel Corporation has dominated the market for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives, and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">8</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s dominant position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel also leverages its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its integrated chipsets. Intel manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. The continued improvement of the quality of Intel’s integrated graphics, along with higher unit shipments of our APU products, may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for mobile PCs, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users, at a lower cost. Intel could also take actions that place our discrete GPUs at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s:</p><ul id="l2"><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">product mix and introduction schedules;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers and channel partners;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers.</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel’s dominant position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Other competitors include companies providing ARM-based designs used in the mobile and embedded electronics market as relatively low cost and small microprocessors and also in form factors that offer an alternative to mainstream PCs such as netbooks and tablets. ARM Limited designs and licenses its ARM architecture and offers supporting software and services. Our ability to compete with companies who use ARM-based solutions depends on our ability to design energy-efficient, high-performing products at an attractive price point. In addition, Nvidia has begun to build custom CPU cores based on ARM architecture to support future products ranging from PCs and servers to workstations and super computers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition in the Chipset Market</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">In the chipset market, our competitors include suppliers of integrated graphics chipsets. PC manufacturers use integrated chipsets because they cost less than traditional discrete GPUs while offering acceptable graphics performance for most mainstream PC users. Intel manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor in this market.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition in the Graphics Market</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In the graphics market, our competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics, embedded graphics processors and integrated graphics chipsets. Intel manufactures and sells embedded graphics processors and integrated graphics (IGP) chipsets, and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The continued improvement of the quality of Intel’s integrated graphics, along with higher unit shipments of our APUs, may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for mobile PCs, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users, at a lower cost. Intel could take actions that place our discrete GPUs and integrated chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Other than Intel, our principal competitor in the graphics market is Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia are the two principal players offering discrete graphics solutions. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the game console category, we compete primarily against Nvidia. Other competitors include Intel and ARM.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We focus our research and development activities on improving and enhancing product design. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of products with greater system level integration of the CPU and GPU, improved system performance and performance-per- watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our microprocessors and APU products for mobile PCs and the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing, and gaming and media computing, as well as developing a Heterogeneous System Architecture, which is designed for software developers to easily program APUs by combining scalar processing on the CPU with parallel processing on the GPU, all while providing high bandwidth access to memory at low power. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and we work with others in the industry, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our research and development expenses for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. For more information, see Part II, Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” or MD&amp;A.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Canada, India, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Germany, United Kingdom, Israel and Japan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing Arrangements and Assembly and Test Facilities</p><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Third-Party Wafer Foundry Facilities</h1><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Inc. <span class="p">On March 2, 2009, together with Advanced Technology Investment Company LLC (ATIC) and West Coast Hitech L.P., (WCH), acting through its general partner, West Coast Hitech G.P., Ltd., we formed GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Inc. (GF), a manufacturing joint venture that manufactures semiconductor products and provides certain foundry services to us.</span></h1><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Wafer Supply Agreement. <span class="p">At the closing of the transactions, we entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA), which governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor unit and APU product requirements from GF with limited exceptions. On April 2, 2011, we amended the WSA. The primary effect of the amendment was to change the pricing methodology applicable to wafers delivered in 2011 for our microprocessors, including APU products. The amendment also modified our existing commitments regarding the production of certain GPU and chipset products at GF. Pursuant to the amendment, GF committed to provide us with, and we committed to purchase, a fixed number of 45nm and 32nm wafers per quarter in 2011. We paid GF a fixed price for 45nm wafers delivered in 2011. Our price for 32nm wafers varied based on the wafer volumes and manufacturing yield of such wafers and was based on good die. In addition, we also agreed to pay an additional quarterly amount to GF during 2012 totaling up to $430 million if GF met specified conditions related to continued availability of 32nm capacity as of the beginning of 2012. Under the current terms of the WSA, in 2012, we will compensate GF on a cost plus basis for projected manufacturing capacity that we have requested for our microprocessors, including our APU products. However, we are currently in the process of negotiating a second amendment to the WSA, including the pricing methodology. If we do not successfully conclude our negotiations, it could have a material adverse impact on our gross margins and our results of operations.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 269pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">10</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The WSA terminates no later than March 2, 2024. GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider, and to continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the WSA. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor products will remain as set forth in the WSA, but our purchase commitments to GF will no longer apply.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GF manufactures our microprocessors on 300 millimeter wafers using primarily 45nm and 32nm process technology.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company<span class="p">. We also have foundry arrangements with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for the production of certain graphics processors and chipsets, embedded processors, and APU products.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We are in production in TSMC’s 300 millimeter and 200 millimeter fabrication facilities in technologies ranging from 65nm to 28nm. Smaller process geometries can lead to gains in performance, lower power consumption and lower per unit manufacturing costs. We continue to have our products manufactured on more advanced process technology because using more advanced process technology can contribute to lower product manufacturing costs and improve a product’s performance and power efficiency.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other Third-Party Manufacturers. <span class="p">We outsource board-level graphics product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We own and operate three assembly, test, mark and packaging facilities.

Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and maskwork rights. As of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">December 31, 2011 we had approximately 4,500 patents in the United States and approximately 1,500 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration thereof, is or would be material to our business.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. One such agreement is the cross-license agreement that we entered into with Intel on November 11, 2009, in connection with the settlement of our litigation. Under the cross license agreement, Intel has granted to us and our subsidiaries, and we have granted Intel and its subsidiaries, non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses to all patents that are either owned or controlled by the parties at any time that have a first effective filing date or priority date prior to the five-year anniversary of the effective date of the cross license agreement, referred to as the “Capture Period,” to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise dispose of certain semiconductor- and electronic-related products anywhere in the world. Under the cross license agreement, Intel has rights to make semiconductor products for third parties, but the third party product designs are not licensed as a result of such manufacture. We have rights to perform assembly and testing for third parties but not rights to make semiconductor products for third parties. The term of the cross license agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents, unless earlier terminated. A party can terminate the cross license agreement or the rights and licenses of the other party if the other party materially breaches the cross license agreement and does not correct the noticed material breach within 60 days. Upon such termination, the terminated party’s license rights terminate but the terminating party’s license rights continue, subject to that party’s continued compliance with the terms of the cross license agreement. The cross license agreement and the Capture Period will automatically terminate if a party undergoes a change of control (as defined in the cross license agreement) and both parties’ licenses will terminate. Upon the bankruptcy of a party, that party may assume, but may not assign, the cross license agreement, and in the event that the cross license agreement cannot be assumed, the cross license agreement and the licenses granted will terminate.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 269pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">11</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We also have a patent cross license agreement with GF pursuant to which each party granted to the other a non-exclusive license under patents filed by a party (or are otherwise acquired by a party) within a certain number of years following the effective date of the agreement. In 2009, under the agreements with GF, we assigned approximately 3,000 patents and approximately 1,000 patent applications to GF. GF owns its allocation of patents and applications subject to pre-existing rights, licenses or immunities granted to third parties relating to such patents and applications. The patents and patent applications to be owned by each party after the division were licensed to the other party pursuant to the agreement.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In addition, we entered into a Non-Patent Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer Agreement with GF pursuant to which we assigned to GF all of our right, title and interest in technology and non-patent intellectual property rights used exclusively in the manufacture, sorting and/or intermediate testing of semiconductor products. We retained technology and non-patent intellectual property rights used exclusively in the design and/or post-fabrication delivery testing of semiconductors. Technology and non-patent intellectual property rights used both in the manufacture, sorting and/or intermediate testing of semiconductor products and in the design and/or post-fabrication delivery testing of semiconductor products is owned jointly by us and GF.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We sell standard lines of products. Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Some of these orders or agreements may be revised or cancelled without penalty. Generally, in light of current industry practice, we do not believe that such orders or agreements provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 11,100 employees.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Environmental Regulations</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Many aspects of our business operations and products are regulated by domestic and international environmental laws and regulations. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air, water, and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and requirements with respect to treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. If we fail to comply with any of the applicable environmental regulations we may be subject to fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, and/or criminal and civil liabilities. Existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment; to modify product designs; or to incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure to adequately control the use, disposal or storage, or discharge of hazardous substances could expose us to future liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental requirements and do not expect those requirements to result in material expenditures in the foreseeable future.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and material composition of our products. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products with other countries implementing similar restrictions. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. There is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are required to be lead-free, as defined by these regulations, or that are subject to other chemical restrictions, may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to chemical restrictions, or that the transition to products subject to lead-free or other chemical restrictions may produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the SEC to establish new disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. When these new requirements are implemented, they could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, and there will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflicting minerals used in our products.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict free.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 269pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">12</p></body></html>
