An integrated circuit, or IC, is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost per function. In order to satisfy the demand for faster, smaller and lower-cost ICs, semiconductor companies have continually developed improvements in manufacturing and process technology and design. ICs are increasingly being manufactured using smaller geometries on larger silicon wafers. Use of smaller process geometries can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and cost less to manufacture on a per unit basis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Computing Solutions</p><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -22pt;line-height: 151%;text-align: left;">The x86 Microprocessor Market Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the central processing unit, or CPU, of a computer. It generally consists of millions of transistors that process data and control other devices in the system, acting as the brain of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of a computer and numerous other electronic systems. The principal indicators of CPU performance are work-per-cycle, or how many instructions are executed per cycle, clock speed, representing the rate at which a CPUs internal logic operates, measured in units of gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second, and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the number of cores in a microprocessor, the bit rating of the microprocessor, memory size and data access speed.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Developments in circuit design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Currently, microprocessors are designed to process 32 bits or 64 bits of information at one time. The bit rating of a microprocessor generally denotes the largest size of numerical data that a microprocessor can handle. Microprocessors with 64-bit processing capabilities enable systems to have greater performance by allowing software applications and operating systems to access more memory.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Moreover, as businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, semiconductor companies are designing and developing multi-core microprocessors, where multiple processor cores are placed on a single die or in a single processor. Multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores each of which can execute a task at full speed. Multiple processor cores packaged together can increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. This type of “symmetrical multiprocessing” is effective in multi-tasking environments where multiple cores can enable operating systems to prioritize and manage tasks from multiple software applications simultaneously and also for “multi-threaded” software applications where multiple cores can process different parts of the software program, or “threads,” simultaneously thereby enhancing performance of the application. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which allows them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems thereby reducing the total cost of ownership.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">3</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Accelerated Processing Unit (APU)</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">While general purpose computer architectures based on the x86 architecture are sufficient for many customers, we believe that an architecture that optimizes the use of a CPU and graphics processing unit, or GPU, for a given workload can provide a substantial improvement in user experience, performance and energy efficiency. As the volume of digital media increases, we believe end users can benefit from an accelerated computing architecture. An accelerated computing architecture enables “offloading” of selected tasks, thereby optimizing the use of multiple computational units such as the CPU and GPU, depending on the application or workload. For example, serial workloads are better suited for CPUs, while highly parallel tasks may be better performed by a GPU. Our AMD Accelerated Processing Unit, or APU, combines our CPU and GPU onto a single piece of silicon. We believe that high performance computing workloads, workloads that are visual in nature and even traditional applications such as photo and video editing or other multi-media applications can benefit from our accelerated computing architecture.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Microprocessor Products</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We currently design, develop and sell microprocessor products for servers, desktop PCs and mobile devices, including mobile PCs and tablets. Our microprocessors and chipsets are incorporated into computing platforms that also include GPUs and core software to enable and advance the computing components. A platform is a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete computing solution. We believe that integrated, balanced platforms consisting of microprocessors, chipsets and GPUs that work together at the system level bring end users improved system stability, increased performance and enhanced power efficiency. Furthermore, by combining all of these elements onto a single piece of silicon as an APU, we believe system performance and power efficiency is further improved. In addition to the enhancements at the end-user level, we believe our customers also benefit from an all-AMD platform, as we are able to provide them with a single point of contact for the key platform components and enable them to bring the platforms to market faster in a variety of client and server system form factors.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our CPUs and APUs are manufactured primarily using 45-nanometer (nm), 40nm, 32nm or 28nm process technology. We currently base our microprocessors and chipsets on the x86 instruction set architecture and AMD’s Direct Connect Architecture, which connects an on-chip memory controller and input/output, or I/O, channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores. We typically integrate two or more processor cores onto a single die, and each core has its own dedicated cache, which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die, permitting quicker access to frequently used data and instructions. Some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as L2, or second level cache, and L3, or third level cache, to enable faster data access and higher performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Energy efficiency and power consumption continue to be key design principles for our products. We focus on continually improving power management technology, or “performance-per-watt.” To that end, we offer CPUs, APUs and chipsets with features that we have designed to reduce system level energy consumption, with multiple low power states which utilize lower clock speeds and voltages that reduce processor power consumption during both active and idle times. We design our CPUs and APUs to be compatible with operating system software such as the Microsoft<span class="s6">® </span>Windows<span class="s6">® </span>family of operating systems, Linux<span class="s6">®</span>, NetWare<span class="s6">®</span>, Solaris and UNIX.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our AMD family of APUs represents a new approach to processor design and software development, delivering serial, parallel and visual compute capabilities for high definition (HD) video, 3D and data-intensive workloads in the APU. APUs combine high-performance serial and parallel processing cores with other special-purpose hardware accelerators. We design our APUs for improved visual computing, security, performance-per-watt and smaller device form factors. Having the CPU and GPU on the same chip reduces the system power and bill-of- materials, speeds the flow of data between the CPU and GPU through shared memory and allows the GPU to function as both a graphic engine and an application accelerator in high efficient compute platforms.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">4</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 127pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">™</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 269pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">™                                 ™</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Building on the integration of our CPU and GPU onto a single piece of silicon, we are focused on evolving our accelerated computing architecture in such a manner so that software programmers see a single multi-purpose processing unit. Heterogeneous Systems Architecture (HSA) describes our overarching design for having combinations of CPU and GPU processor cores operate as a unified engine that we intend to be both higher performance and lower power than our previous architectures.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Server. <span class="p">A server is a system that performs services for connected clients as part of a client-server architecture. Servers are designed to run an application or applications, often for extended periods of time with minimal human direction. Examples of servers include web servers, e-mail servers and print servers. These servers run a variety of applications including business intelligence, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and advanced scientific or engineering models to solve advanced computational problems in disciplines ranging from financial modeling to weather forecasting to oil and gas exploration. Servers are also used in cloud computing which is a computing model where data, applications and services are delivered over the internet or an intranet.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our microprocessors for traditional server platforms consist of our AMD Opteron<span class="s6">™ </span>6000, 4000 and 3000 series processors.

Our fabric technology, AMD SeaMicro Freedom supercompute fabric, links together hundreds of card-sized CPUs to create a large array of independent but linked CPUs. Work is distributed over these CPUs through hardware and software based load-balancing technology that directs traffic across the fabric such that each CPU is in its most efficient zone of performance. We designed this fabric to reduce power consumption while providing lower latency, lower cost and higher bandwidth.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In March 2012, we launched the AMD Opteron 3200 Series server processor. This entry-level server processor is designed for dedicated web hosting providers who are seeking enterprise-class servers at lower price points. In September 2012, we announced AMD’s SeaMicro SM15000 server chassis, which extends fabric-based computing across racks and aisles of the data center to connect directly to large data storage systems. In November 2012, we launched the AMD Opteron 6300 Series processor based on “Piledriver,” our next-generation high performance x86 multi-core architecture. We designed the AMD Opteron 6300 Series processor to balance performance, scalability and cost effectiveness to help IT organizations lower total cost of ownership. In December 2012, we launched the AMD Opteron 4300 and 3300 Series server processor, which is also based on our next-generation “Piledriver” core architecture. These processors are designed for cloud providers, web hosts and small- and medium-sized businesses to help them address space and power constraints.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Mobile Devices. <span class="p">Consumers continue to demand thinner and lighter mobile platforms with better entertainment performance and longer battery life.

Chipsets perform essential logic functions and balance the performance of the system and aid in removing bottlenecks. Chipsets often</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">6</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">include graphics, audio, video and other capabilities. All desktop and mobile PCs as well as servers have a chipset. In many PCs, the chipset includes a graphics processing unit (GPU). A GPU within the chipset solution is commonly known as an integrated graphics processor (IGP), and such a chipset may be called an IGP chipset. In a system without an integrated graphics processor, a discrete GPU is usually required. By not necessitating a discrete GPU, IGP chipsets offer a lower cost solution and reduced power consumption and enable smaller system form factors. With our APU architecture, the GPU is included in the APU and the AMD Controller Hub chip performs the input and output functions of the chipset. We believe that the combination of an APU and the AMD Controller Hub will replace our market for IGP chipsets.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Our portfolio of chipset products includes chipsets with and without IGPs for desktop PCs and servers, and AMD Controller Hub-based chipsets for our APUs. We offer AMD A50-Series, A60-Series and A70-Series chipsets for our mobile PC platforms. As well, we offer AMD 9-Series, 8-Series, 7-Series Discrete and AMD 7-Series Integrated chipsets for desktop PCs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Graphics</p><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Graphics Market</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">A graphics solution can be in the form of either an APU, a GPU, an IGP, or a combination of a GPU with one of the other foregoing products working in tandem. The semiconductor graphics market addresses the need for visual or parallel processing in various computing and entertainment platforms such as desktop PCs, mobile PCs and workstations</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">APUs and IGPs deliver discrete GPU level functionality for value and mainstream PCs while discrete GPUs are specifically architected for high performance graphics processing. A dedicated GPU and CPU work in tandem to increase overall speed and performance of the system. Users of these graphics products value a rich visual experience, particularly in the high-end enthusiast market where consumers often seek out the fastest and highest performing visual processing products to enable the most compelling and immersive experiences. Moreover, for many consumers, the PC is evolving from a traditional data processing and communications device to an entertainment platform. Visual realism and graphical display capabilities are key elements of product differentiation among various product platforms. This has led to the increasing creation and use of processing intensive multimedia content for PCs and to manufacturers designing PCs for playing games, displaying photos and capturing TV and other multimedia content, viewing online videos, photo editing and managing digital content. In turn, the trend has contributed to the development of higher performance graphics solutions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Graphics Products</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our customers generally use our graphics solutions to increase the speed of rendering images and to improve image resolution and color definition.

AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing or GPGPU (General Purpose GPU) refers to a set of advanced hardware and software technologies that enable AMD GPUs, working in concert with the computer system’s CPUs, to accelerate applications beyond traditional graphics and video processing by allowing the CPUs and GPUs to process information cooperatively. Heterogeneous computing, which refers to computer systems that use more than one kind of processor, enables PCs and servers to run computationally-intensive tasks more efficiently, which we believe provides a superior application experience to the end user.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">7</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">™</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><span class="h1">Discrete Desktop Graphics. </span>We believe that discrete graphic solutions will continue to be popular across desktop PC configurations and platforms designed for gaming, multimedia, photo and video editing as well as other graphic-intensive applications.

Products typically compete on product quality, power consumption (including battery life), reliability, speed, performance, size (or form factor), cost, selling price, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), software and hardware compatibility and stability, brand recognition, timely product introductions and availability. Technological advances in the industry result in frequent product introductions, regular price reductions, short product life cycles and increased product capabilities that may result in significant performance improvements. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to develop, introduce and sell new products or enhanced versions of existing products on a timely basis and at competitive prices, while reducing our costs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition in the Microprocessor Market</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel Corporation has dominated the market for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives, and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s dominant position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 216pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">11</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel also leverages its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its integrated graphics chipsets. Intel manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. Intel could also take actions that place our discrete GPUs at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s:</p><ul id="l2"><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">product mix and introduction schedules;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers and channel partners;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel’s dominant position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Other competitors include companies providing or developing ARM-based designs as relatively low cost and low power processors for the computing market including netbooks, tablets and thin client form factors, as well as dense servers, set-top boxes and gaming consoles. ARM Holdings designs and licenses its ARM architecture and offers supporting software and services. Our ability to compete with companies who use ARM-based solutions depends on our ability to design energy-efficient, high-performing products at an attractive price point. In addition, Nvidia builds custom CPU cores based on ARM architecture to support tablets and small form factor PCs, servers, workstations and super computers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition in the Chipset Market</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">In the chipset market, our competitors include suppliers of integrated graphics chipsets. PC manufacturers use integrated chipsets because they cost less than traditional discrete GPUs while offering acceptable graphics performance for most mainstream PC users. Intel manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor in this market.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition in the Graphics Market</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In the graphics market, our competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics, embedded graphics processors and IGPs. Intel manufactures and sells embedded graphics processors and IGP chipsets, and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The continued improvement of the quality of Intel’s integrated graphics, along with higher unit shipments of our APUs, may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for mobile PCs, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users, at a lower cost. Intel could take actions that place our discrete GPUs and integrated chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 216pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">12</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Other than Intel, our principal competitor in the graphics market is Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia are the two principal players offering discrete graphics solutions. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the game console category, we compete primarily against Nvidia. Other competitors include Intel, ARM and Imagination.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We focus our research and development activities on improving and enhancing product design. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of products with greater system level integration of the CPU and GPU, improved system performance and performance-per- watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our microprocessors and APU products for mobile PCs and the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing, and gaming and media computing, as well as developing a Heterogeneous System Architecture, which is designed for software developers to easily program APUs by combining scalar processing on the CPU with parallel processing on the GPU, all while providing high bandwidth access to memory at low power. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and we work with others in the industry, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Our research and development expenses for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were approximately $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.

Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements from GF with limited exceptions.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">On April 2, 2011, we entered into a first amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the amendment was to change the pricing methodology applicable to wafers delivered in 2011 for our microprocessors, including APU products. The amendment also modified our existing commitments regarding the production of certain GPU and chipset products at GF. Pursuant to the amendment, GF committed to provide us with, and we committed to purchase, a fixed number of 45nm and 32nm wafers per quarter in 2011. We paid GF a fixed price for 45nm wafers delivered in 2011. Our price for 32nm wafers varied based on the wafer volumes and manufacturing yield of such wafers and was based on good die. In addition, we also agreed to pay an additional quarterly amount to</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 216pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">13</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">GF during 2012 totaling up to $430 million if GF met specified conditions related to the continued availability of 32nm capacity as of the beginning of 2012. As part of the second amendment described below, GF agreed to waive these quarterly payments, and therefore we are no longer required to pay them.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">On March 4, 2012, we entered into a second amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of this second amendment was to modify certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products to be delivered by GF to us during 2012.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Pursuant to the second amendment, GF committed to provide us with, and we committed to purchase, a fixed number of production wafers in 2012. We paid GF fixed prices for production wafers delivered in 2012. The second amendment also granted us certain rights to contract with another wafer foundry supplier with respect to specified 28nm products for a specified period of time. In consideration for these rights, we agreed to pay GF $425 million and transfer to GF all of the capital stock of GF that we owned. Pursuant to the second amendment, $150 million of the $425 million was paid on March 5, 2012, $50 million was paid on June 29, 2012, $50 million was paid on October 1, 2012, and the remaining $175 million was paid by December 31, 2012. In addition, as security for the final two payments, we issued a $225 million promissory note to GF.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">On December 6, 2012, we entered into a third amendment to the WSA. Pursuant to the third amendment we modified our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 under the second amendment to the WSA. In addition, we agreed to certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products to be delivered by GF to us during 2013 and through December 31, 2013. Pursuant to the third amendment, we committed to purchase a fixed number of production wafers at negotiated prices in the fourth quarter of 2012 and through December 31, 2013. GF agreed to waive a portion of our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration for this waiver, we agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million. The cash impact of this $320 million fee will be spread over several quarters, with $80 million paid by December 28, 2012 and $40 million payable by April 1, 2013. For the remainder of the fee, on the same date we entered into the third amendment, we issued a $200 million promissory note to GF that matures on December 31, 2013. As part of the third amendment, we committed to purchase wafers from GF for approximately $250 million during the first quarter of 2014. We expect to negotiate the remainder of our 2014 purchase commitments from GF in 2013.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The WSA terminates no later than March 2, 2024. GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider, and to continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the WSA. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor products will remain as set forth in the WSA, but our purchase commitments to GF will no longer apply.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GF currently manufactures our microprocessors on 300 millimeter wafers using primarily 45nm and 32nm process technology.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company<span class="p">.

Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and maskwork rights. As of December 29, 2012, we had approximately 4,700 patents in the United States and approximately 1,600 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration thereof, is or would be material to our business.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. One such agreement is the cross-license agreement that we entered into with Intel on November 11, 2009, in connection with the settlement of our litigation. Under the cross license agreement, Intel has granted to us and our subsidiaries, and we have granted Intel and its subsidiaries, non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses to all patents that are either owned or controlled by the parties at any time that have a first effective filing date or priority date prior to the five-year anniversary of the effective date of the cross license agreement, referred to as the “Capture Period,” to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise dispose of certain semiconductor- and electronic-related products anywhere in the world. Under the cross license agreement, Intel has rights to make semiconductor products for third parties, but the third party product designs are not licensed as a result of such manufacture. We have rights to perform assembly and testing for third parties but not rights to make semiconductor products for third parties. The term of the cross license agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents, unless earlier terminated. A party can terminate the cross license agreement or the rights and licenses of the other party if the other party materially breaches the cross license agreement and does not correct the noticed material breach within 60 days. Upon such termination, the terminated party’s license rights terminate but the terminating party’s license rights continue, subject to that party’s continued compliance with the terms of the cross license agreement. The cross license agreement and the Capture Period will automatically terminate if a party undergoes a change of control (as defined in the cross license agreement) and both parties’ licenses will terminate. Upon the bankruptcy of a party, that party may assume, but may not assign, the cross license agreement, and in the event that the cross license agreement cannot be assumed, the cross license agreement and the licenses granted will terminate.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We also have a patent cross license agreement with GF pursuant to which each party granted to the other a non-exclusive license under patents filed by a party (or are otherwise acquired by a party) within a certain number of years following the effective date of the agreement. In 2009, under the agreements with GF, we</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 216pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">15</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">assigned approximately 3,000 patents and approximately 1,000 patent applications to GF. GF owns its allocation of patents and applications subject to pre-existing rights, licenses or immunities granted to third parties relating to such patents and applications. The patents and patent applications to be owned by each party after the division were licensed to the other party pursuant to the agreement.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In addition, we entered into a Non-Patent Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer Agreement with GF pursuant to which we assigned to GF all of our right, title and interest in technology and non-patent intellectual property rights used exclusively in the manufacture, sorting and/or intermediate testing of semiconductor products. We retained technology and non-patent intellectual property rights used exclusively in the design and/or post-fabrication delivery testing of semiconductors. Technology and non-patent intellectual property rights used both in the manufacture, sorting and/or intermediate testing of semiconductor products and in the design and/or post-fabrication delivery testing of semiconductor products are owned jointly by us and GF.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">We sell standard lines of products. Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Some of these orders or agreements may be revised or cancelled without penalty. Generally, in light of current industry practice, we do not believe that such orders or agreements provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of December 29, 2012, we had approximately 10,340 employees.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Environmental Regulations</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Many aspects of our business operations and products are regulated by domestic and international environmental laws and regulations. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air, water, and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and requirements with respect to treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. If we fail to comply with any of the applicable environmental regulations we may be subject to fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, and/or criminal and civil liabilities. Existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment; to modify product designs; or to incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure to adequately control the use, disposal or storage, or discharge of hazardous substances could expose us to future liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental requirements and do not expect those requirements to result in material expenditures in the foreseeable future.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. Other countries have also implemented similar restrictions. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions, may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In August 2012, the SEC adopted its final rule to implement Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding disclosure and reporting requirements for companies who use</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 216pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">16</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">“conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. As there are many sources of these materials, these new requirements are unlikely to affect the sourcing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices but will add additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the US government. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict free and if we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor’s products.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia and China are developing or finalizing market entry or public procurement requirements for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specification as well as additional energy consumption limits. Some of these regulations are expected to be approved and implemented in 2013. If such regulations do not contain recommended modifications as proposed by AMD or industry associations, there is the potential for certain of our microprocessor, chipset and GPU products, as incorporated in desktop and mobile PCs, workstations, servers and other information and communications technology products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us.

RISK FACTORS</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effects of two or more risks occurring simultaneously.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively.</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel Corporation has dominated the market for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives, and to discipline customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s dominant position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel also leverages its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its integrated graphics chipsets. Intel manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. Intel could also take actions that place our discrete GPUs at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s:</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">product mix and introduction schedules;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers and channel partners;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers.</p></li></ul><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 216pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">18</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Intel’s dominant position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions.</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. For example, form factors have increasingly shifted from desktop PCs to mobile PCs, and tablets have been one of the fastest growing form factors. Also, ARM-based processors are being used in mobile and embedded electronics products as relatively low cost and small microprocessors and also in form factors such as laptops, tablets and smartphones. Historically, a significant portion of our Computing Solutions revenue has been related to desktop PCs. Currently, approximately 85% of our business is focused on the legacy PC portions of the market, projected to have slowing growth over the next several years. To the extent consumers adopt new form factors and have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could negatively impact our business. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Delays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers’ product design windows. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems, they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer’s system can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Moreover, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the average selling price undergoes regular price reductions. The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain an overall corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficient increases in average selling price or increased unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the average selling price of existing products, our business could be materially adversely affected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Global economic uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.</h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business. Uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases. For example, our revenue in the second half of 2012 was adversely affected, in part, by the overall weakness in the global economy and weak consumer demand for end-user PC products, which impacted sales. We do not expect PC market conditions to improve during the first half of 2013.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">In addition, during challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.
