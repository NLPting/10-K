Business</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">We incorporated in 1985 under the laws of the state of California. In 1991, we reincorporated in the state of Delaware. We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Our 52-week fiscal years consist of four equal fiscal quarters of 13 weeks each, and our 53-week fiscal years consist of three 13-week fiscal quarters and one 14-week fiscal quarter. The financial results for our 53-week fiscal years and our 14-week fiscal quarters will not be exactly comparable to our 52-week fiscal years and our 13-week fiscal quarters. Both of the fiscal years ended September 28, 2014 and September 29, 2013 included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 included 53 weeks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Overview</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">We continue to lead the development and commercialization of a digital communication technology called CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), and we own significant intellectual property applicable to products that implement any version of CDMA, including patents, patent applications and trade secrets. The mobile communications industry generally recognizes that a company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell products that use CDMA technology will require a patent license from us. CDMA is one of the main technologies currently used in digital wireless communications networks (also known as wireless networks). Based on wireless connections, CDMA and TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), of which GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) is the primary commercial form, are the primary digital technologies currently used to transmit a wireless device user’s voice or data over radio waves using a public cellular wireless network.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We also continue our significant role in the development and commercialization of OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) technology for which we own substantial intellectual property. Sales of multimode CDMA and LTE (which stands for Long Term Evolution and is an OFDMA-based standard for cellular wireless communication applications) wireless devices have grown significantly during the past several years.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">We also develop and commercialize several other key technologies used in handsets and tablets that contribute to end-user demand, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these were contributed to and are being commercialized as industry standards, such as certain audio and video codecs, the advanced WLAN (wireless local area networks, or Wi-Fi) 802.11 functionality and volatile and non-volatile memory controllers. Other technologies widely used by wireless devices that we have developed are not related to any industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, integrated circuit packaging techniques, sensors and sensor fusion algorithms and application processor architectures.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">In addition to licensing portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, we design, manufacture, have manufactured on our behalf and market products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and other digital communications technologies. Our products principally consist of integrated circuits (also known as chips or chipsets) and system software used in mobile devices and in wireless networks. We also sell other products and services, which include: integrated circuits for use in wired devices, particularly broadband gateway equipment, desktop computers and streaming media players; software products and content enablement services for wireless operators; and products designed for the implementation of small cells.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014-3/Image_001.png"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">State of the Mobile Industry</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The mobile industry has experienced tremendous growth over the past 20 years, growing from less than 60 million global connections in 1994 (WCIS+, October 2014) to approximately 7 billion global connections in September 2014 (GSMA Intelligence, November 2014). As the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has made peoples’ lives more connected, transforming the way we interact with one another and with the world. The scale and pace of innovation in mobile, especially around connectivity and computing capabilities, is impacting industries beyond wireless.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Extending connectivity. <span class="p">3G/4G (third generation/fourth generation) multimode mobile broadband technology has been a key driver of the growth of mobile, providing users with fast, reliable, always-on connectivity. As of September 2014, there were approximately 2.8 billion 3G/4G connections globally (CDMA-based, OFDMA-based and CDMA/OFDMA multimode) representing nearly 40% of total mobile connections, and by 2018, 3G/4G connections are projected to surpass 5 billion globally, with approximately three-quarters of this growth occurring in emerging regions (GSMA Intelligence, November 2014).</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">3G/4G multimode mobile broadband has also emerged as an important platform for extending the reach and potential of the Internet. In 2010, the number of broadband connections using mobile technology surpassed those using fixed technologies, making mobile networks the primary method of access to the Internet for many people around the world. The impact is further amplified in emerging regions, where 3G/4G connections are approximately four times the number of fixed Internet connections (GSMA Intelligence, November 2014 and WBIS, October 2014). Mobile broadband may be the first, and in many cases only, way that people in these regions access the Internet. 3G/4G LTE multimode services are being rolled out in China, which we expect will encourage competition and growth, bring the benefits of 3G/4G LTE multimode to consumers, encourage consumers to replace 2G, or second generation, (GSM) and 3G devices and enable new opportunities for the industry.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Growth in smartphones. <span class="p">Smartphone adoption is growing worldwide, fueled by ultra-fast 3G/4G LTE multimode connectivity, powerful application processors (now delivering speeds over 2 GHz) and advanced multimedia and location aware capabilities. In 2013, nearly 1 billion smartphones shipped globally, representing a year-over-year increase of more than 40%, and shipments of smartphones between 2014 and 2018 are projected to reach over 8 billion (Gartner, September 2014). Much of this growth is happening in emerging regions, where smartphones represented 46% of total handset shipments in 2013 and are expected to reach approximately 89% in 2018 (Gartner, September 2014). Declining costs and the rapid expansion of entry-level smartphones have been and are expected to continue to be key to this growth.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">Consumer demand for new types of experiences, combined with the need by mobile operators and device manufacturers to provide differentiated features and services, is driving continued innovation within the smartphone. This innovation is happening across multiple technology dimensions, including connectivity, application processors, camera, audio, video, location, radio frequencies and sensors. As a result, the smartphone has supplanted in many ways the personal computer as the go-to device for email, web browsing, music, gaming, social networking and more. It is also replacing many traditional consumer electronics items due to its advanced capabilities, including digital cameras, video cameras, Global Positioning System (GPS) units and music players.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Meeting data demand. <span class="p">As more smartphones and other connected devices come online, data usage is growing rapidly, putting a tremendous strain on the capacity of mobile networks. To meet the challenge resulting from increased demand for data, mobile operators are looking at a variety of methods to improve the performance and capacity of their networks, including acquiring additional spectrum, using more efficient air-interface technologies (derived from the continued evolution of 3G/4G and Wi-Fi technologies) and leveraging both licensed and unlicensed spectrum. An additional approach is network densification, in which very small, lower-power base stations, known as small cells, are deployed close to the end user to complement the larger “macro” network.</span></h1><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Addressing new opportunities. <span class="p">The mobile industry is leveraging the same technology innovations found in smartphones to extend advanced connectivity and computing capabilities into a broad array of end-devices and access points, which make up the “edge” of the Internet. With billions of connected devices projected to be added over the coming years, enhancing the capabilities of the network will be vital to improving its scalability and performance as it enters this new phase of growth. These enhancements are helping to transform industry segments, including the connected home, tablets, automotive, health care and wearables, as companies leverage mobile connectivity and computing technology to create intelligently connected products and services and reach new customers.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The proliferation of intelligently connected “things” (e.g., consumer electronics, appliances and cars) is enabling new types of user experiences, as smartphones are able to interact with and control more of the things around us. Through the addition of embedded sensors, connected things are able to collect and send data on their environment, providing users with contextually relevant information and further increasing their utility and value. We refer to this as the Internet of Everything.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">2</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014-3/Image_002.png"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wireless Technologies</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The growth in the use of wireless devices worldwide, such as smartphones and tablets, and demand for data services and applications requires continuous innovation to further improve the user experience, enable new services and increase network capacity, make use of different frequency bands and enable dense network deployments. To meet these requirements, different wireless communications technologies continue to evolve. For over two decades, we have invested and continue to invest heavily in research and development of many of these cellular wireless communication technologies, including CDMA and OFDMA. As a result, we have developed and acquired (and continue to develop and acquire) significant related intellectual property. This intellectual property has been incorporated into the most widely accepted and deployed wireless communications technology standards, and we have licensed it to wireless device and infrastructure manufacturers (more than 260 licensees, including all leading manufacturers). Most of the cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into three categories.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">TDMA-based. <span class="p">TDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency channel by dividing the signal into different time slots. Most of these systems are classified as 2G technology.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The main examples of TDMA-based technologies are GSM (deployed worldwide), IS-136 (deployed in the Americas) and Personal Digital Cellular (PDC) (deployed in Japan). Compared to the earlier generations of analog technologies, these digital communications technologies provided for significantly enhanced efficiency within a fixed spectrum, resulting in increased voice capacity. These technologies also enable enhanced services, such as SMS (short message service) texting service, as well as low-speed data services. GSM has evolved to support mobile packet data transmission, such as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) and EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">According to GSMA Intelligence estimates as of November 3, 2014, there were approximately 4.2 billion GSM connections worldwide, representing approximately 60% of total cellular connections. The transition of wireless devices from 2G to 3G/4G continued around the world with 3G/4G connections up 24% year-over-year.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">CDMA-based. <span class="p">CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified as 3G technology. We lead the development of CDMA-based technologies.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">There are a number of variants of CDMA-based technologies deployed around the world, in particular CDMA2000, EV-DO (Evolution Data Optimized), WCDMA (Wideband CDMA) and TD-SCDMA (Time Division-Synchronous CDMA) (deployed exclusively in China). CDMA-based technologies provide vastly improved capacity for voice and low-rate data services as compared to analog technologies and significant improvements over TDMA-based technologies, such as GSM. The following are the CDMA-based technologies and their standards revisions:</p><ul id="l1"><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">CDMA2000 revisions A through E</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">1xEV-DO revisions A through C</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">WCDMA/HSPA releases 4 through 12</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">TD-SCDMA releases 4 through 12</p></li></ul><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">To date, these technologies have seen many revisions, and they continue to evolve, progressively offering higher capacity and data rates, improved user experiences and new applications and services. As these technologies continue to evolve, new features are being defined in their relevant standardization bodies, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) for CDMA2000 and 1xEV-DO and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for WCDMA and TD-SCDMA.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">For simplicity, the releases of these technologies are often combined and given “marketing” or “trade” names that also indicate their benefits. One example is the 3GPP releases: Releases 5 and 6 together are called HSPA (High Speed Packet Access). The releases from 7 to 10 are called HSPA+, indicating that they provide performance improvements over HSPA. We refer to releases 11 and beyond as HSPA+ Advanced, again indicating improvements beyond the ones that HSPA+ offers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The naming convention also applies to the successive releases of CDMA2000, which are grouped and referred to as CDMA2000 1X, 1X Advanced, as well as to 1xEV-DO successive releases, which are referred to as EV-DO Revision A, Revision B and DO Advanced.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">CDMA technologies ushered in a significant increase in broadband data services that continue to grow rapidly. According to GSMA Intelligence estimates as of November 3, 2014, there were approximately 2.4 billion CDMA-based connections worldwide, representing approximately 35% of total cellular connections. As of the fourth quarter of calendar 2014, the first phases of 1X Advanced and DO Advanced, as well as up to the eighth release of HSPA+, were commercially launched.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">OFDMA-based. <span class="p">OFDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same frequency band and time by allocating different subcarriers to individual users. Most of the OFDMA-based technologies</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">3</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014-3/Image_003.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">are classified as 4G technology. We continue to play a significant role in the development of LTE and LTE Advanced, which are the predominant 4G technologies.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The primary OFDMA-based technology is LTE, which is incorporated in 3GPP specifications starting from release 8. LTE has two modes, FDD (frequency division duplex) and TDD (time division duplex), to support paired and unpaired spectrum, respectively, and is being developed by 3GPP. The principal benefit of LTE is its ability to leverage wide swaths of spectrum (bandwidths of 10 MHz or more). LTE is designed to seamlessly interwork with 3G through 3G/4G multimode devices. Currently, most LTE devices rely on 3G for voice services across the network, as well as for ubiquitous data services outside the LTE coverage area, and on 4G for data services inside the coverage area. To date, LTE’s voice solution, VoLTE (voice over LTE), has been commercially deployed in only a small number of networks.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">LTE’s releases are often combined and given “marketing” or “trade” names that also indicate their benefits. The name LTE covers releases 8 and 9. Releases 10 and beyond are referred to as LTE Advanced. According to GSMA Intelligence estimates as of November 3, 2014, there were approximately 360 million global 3G/4G multimode connections worldwide, representing approximately 5% of total cellular connections. Carrier aggregation, one of the significant improvements of LTE Advanced, was commercially launched in June 2013. Along with carrier aggregation, LTE Advanced brings many more enhancements, including advanced antenna techniques and optimization for small cells. LTE Advanced continues to evolve; release 12 is expected to be finalized toward the end of calendar 2014, and the work on release 13 has already started. Apart from improving the performance of existing networks, these releases also bring new enhancements, such as LTE Direct for proximity-based device-to-device discovery, the ability to use LTE Advanced in unlicensed spectrum, improved LTE broadcast through carrier aggregation with LTE Advanced in licensed spectrum and optimizations of machine-type communications. (LTE in unlicensed spectrum can be commercialized in countries such as the United States, China and South Korea with the existing release 10 standard; however, it will need new standards in many other countries.) The evolution of LTE will significantly expand the role of LTE Advanced in the future of communications.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">There also have been ongoing efforts to make the interworking between LTE and Wi-Fi more seamless and completely transparent to the users. The seamless interworking will also enable the device to use the best possible link or links depending on conditions of the LTE and Wi-Fi links as the applications run on devices.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other (Non-cellular) Wireless Technologies. <span class="p">There are other non-cellular wireless technologies that have also been broadly adopted in mobile cellular devices.</span></h1><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Wireless Local Area Networks. <span class="p">Wireless local area networks (WLAN, also known as Wi-Fi) link two or more devices wirelessly and usually provide connectivity through an access point. WLAN systems have been standardized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in the 802.11 family of standards.</span></p><ol id="l2"><ol id="l3"><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">ac, which includes advanced features, such as multiple user multiple in/multiple out (MU MIMO) and support for large bandwidths and higher order modulation, primarily targets broadband connectivity for mobile devices, laptops and consumer electronics devices using 5 GHz spectrum. 802.11ad provides multi-gigabit data rates for short range communication, using 60 GHz spectrum. 802.11ah, which is still under development and targets sub-GHz spectrum, is envisioned to be a solution for “connected home” applications that require long battery life. We played a leading role in the development of 802.11ac, 802.11ad and 802.11ah.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Bluetooth. <span class="p">Bluetooth is a wireless personal area network that provides wireless connectivity between devices over short distances ranging from a few centimeters to a few meters. Bluetooth technology provides wireless connectivity to a wide range of fixed or mobile consumer electronics devices. Bluetooth functionalities are standardized by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group in various versions of the specification (from 1.0 to 4.0), which include different functionalities, such as enhanced data rate or low energy (known as Bluetooth Smart).</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Location Positioning Technologies. <span class="p">Location positioning technologies have evolved rapidly in the industry over the past few years in order to deliver an enhanced location experience. In the past, satellite navigation systems were predominantly used to provide the accurate location of mobile devices.

Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the package assembly and test manufacturing processes. The semiconductor package supports the electrical contacts that connect the integrated circuit to a circuit board. Die cut from silicon wafers are the essential components of all of our integrated circuits and a significant portion of the total integrated circuit cost. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase die or wafers from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party suppliers for manufacturing services such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">We rely on independent third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs. Our suppliers also are responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. The primary foundry suppliers for our various digital, analog/mixed-signal, RF and PM integrated circuits are Global Foundries Inc., International Business Machines Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and United Microelectronics Corporation. The primary semiconductor assembly and test suppliers are Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Amkor Technology, Siliconware Precision Industries and STATSChipPAC. The majority of our foundry and semiconductor assembly and test suppliers are located in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">QCT’s sales are primarily made through standard purchase orders for delivery of products. QCT generally allows customers to reschedule delivery dates within a defined time frame and to cancel orders prior to shipment with or without payment of a penalty, depending on when the order is canceled. The market in which QCT operates is intensely competitive. QCT competes worldwide with a number of United States and international designers and manufacturers of semiconductors. As a result of global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, technological changes, device manufacturer concentrations and the potential for further industry consolidation, we anticipate the market to remain very competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors for our products may include performance, level of integration, quality, compliance with industry standards, price, time-to-market, system cost, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation and customer support. QCT also competes in both single- and dual-mode environments against alternative communications technologies including, but not limited to, GSM/GPRS/EDGE, TDMA and TD-SCDMA.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">6</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014-3/Image_006.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">QCT’s current competitors include, but are not limited to, companies such as Broadcom, Ericsson, HiSilicon Technologies, Intel, Lantiq, Marvell Technology, Maxim Integrated Products, MediaTek, nVidia, Realtek Semiconductor, Samsung Electronics, Spreadtrum Communications (which is controlled by Tsinghua Unigroup), Texas Instruments and VIA Telecom. QCT also faces competition from products internally developed by our customers, including some of our largest customers, and from some early-stage companies. Our competitors devote significant amounts of their financial, technical and other resources to develop and market competitive products and, in some cases, to develop and adopt competitive digital communication or signal processing technologies, and those efforts may materially and adversely affect us. Although we have attained a significant position in the industry, many of our current and potential competitors may have advantages over us, which include, among others: lower cost structures; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to find alternate suppliers or choose alternate technologies; foreign government support of other technologies or our competitors; more extensive relationships with local distribution and original equipment manufacturer companies in emerging geographic regions (such as China); and/or a more established presence in certain device markets.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">QTL Segment. <span class="p">QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD (including TD-SCDMA), GSM/GPRS/EDGE and/or OFDMA (including LTE) standards and their derivatives. Our licensees manufacture wireless products, such as mobile devices, also known as subscriber units, which include handsets, other consumer devices (e.g., tablets, laptops, e-readers, personal navigation devices), machine-to-machine devices (e.g., telematics devices, meter reading devices) and plug-in end user data modem cards, certain embedded modules for incorporation into end user products, the infrastructure equipment required to establish and operate a network, and equipment to test networks and subscriber units. QTL licensing revenues are comprised of license fees as well as royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (e.g., certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT, etc.). Revenues generated from royalties are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations. The vast majority of QTL revenues have been generated through our licensees’ sales of CDMA2000- and WCDMA-based products, such as feature phones and smartphones.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Separate and apart from licensing manufacturers of wireless devices and network equipment, we have entered into certain arrangements with competitors of our QCT segment, such as Broadcom, MediaTek, Texas Instruments and VIA Telecom. A principal purpose of these arrangements is to provide our QCT segment and the counterparties certain freedom of operation with respect to each party’s integrated circuits business. In every case, these agreements expressly reserve the right for QTL to seek royalties from the customers of such integrated circuit suppliers with respect to such suppliers’ customers’ sales of CDMA-, WCDMA- and OFDMA-based wireless devices into which such suppliers’ integrated circuits are incorporated.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">We face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless communications technologies and services. On a worldwide basis, we currently compete primarily with the GSM/GPRS/EDGE digital wireless communications technologies. GSM has been utilized extensively in Europe, much of Asia, other than Japan and South Korea, and certain other countries. To date, GSM has been more widely adopted than CDMA; however, CDMA technologies have been adopted for all 3G wireless systems. Most GSM operators deployed GPRS, a packet data technology, as a 2G bridge technology, and a number of GSM operators deployed EDGE. However, the majority of GSM operators have already augmented their networks with 3G WCDMA and HSPA. According to the Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA), as of October 2014, more than 330 wireless operators have commercially deployed and other wireless operators have started testing LTE, a multi-carrier transmission technique based on OFDMA technology. According to GSA, more than 530 wireless operators have committed to deploy LTE networks. We have invested in both the acquisition and development of OFDMA technology and intellectual property. Upon the initial deployment of OFDMA-based networks, the products implementing such technologies generally are multimode and implement CDMA-based technologies. The licenses granted under our existing CDMA license agreements generally cover multimode CDMA/OFDMA (3G/4G) devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay royalties under their CDMA license agreements for such devices. Further, over 115 companies (including LG, Microsoft, Samsung, Sony Mobile and ZTE) have royalty-bearing licenses under our patent portfolio for use in single-mode OFDMA products (which do not implement any CDMA-based standards).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Since our founding in 1985, we have focused heavily on technology development and innovation. These efforts have resulted in a leading intellectual property portfolio related to, among other things, wireless technology. We have an extensive portfolio of United States and foreign patents, and we continue to pursue patent applications around the world. Our patents have broad coverage in many countries, including Brazil, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and countries in Europe and elsewhere. A substantial portion of our patents and patent applications relate to digital wireless communications technologies, including patents that are essential or may be important to the commercial implementation of CDMA2000, WCDMA (UMTS), TD-SCDMA, TD-CDMA (Time Division CDMA) and OFDMA products.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because all commercially deployed forms of CDMA and their derivatives require the use of our patents, our patent portfolio is the most widely and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">7</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014-3/Image_007.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">extensively licensed portfolio in the industry with over 260 licensees. Additionally, we have a substantial patent portfolio related to key technologies used in communications and other devices and/or related services, some of which were developed in industry standards development bodies. These include H.264 video codec technology, the next generation video codec technology (H.265 or high-efficiency video codec), advanced WLAN (802.11ac), volatile (LP-DDR2, 3, 4) and non-volatile (eMMC) memory controllers, operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing, packaging techniques, sensor and sensor fusion algorithms and application processor architectures. We recently added to our patent portfolio by acquiring patents related to mobile device operating systems (and other/related technologies) from Hewlett Packard, formerly patents of Palm, an early smartphone and personal operating system pioneer. Over the years, a number of companies have challenged our patent position, but at this time, companies in the mobile communications industry generally recognize that any company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell subscriber units or infrastructure equipment that use CDMA and/or OFDMA technologies will require a license or other rights to use our patents.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">We have licensed or otherwise provided rights to use our patents to hundreds of companies on industry-accepted terms. Unlike some other companies in our industry that hold back certain key technologies, we offer companies substantially our entire patent portfolio for use in cellular subscriber devices and cell site infrastructure equipment. Our strategy to make our patented technologies broadly available has been a catalyst for industry growth, helping to enable a wide range of companies offering a broad array of wireless products and features while increasing the capabilities of and/or driving down average and low-end selling prices for 3G handsets and other wireless devices. By licensing or otherwise providing rights to use our patents to a wide range of equipment manufacturers, encouraging innovative applications, supporting equipment manufacturers with integrated chipset and software products and focusing on improving the efficiency of the airlink for wireless operators, we have helped 3G CDMA evolve and grow, and reduced device pricing, all at a faster pace than the 2G technologies that preceded it (e.g., GSM).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Standards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G standards that are based on CDMA. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to license our essential patents for these CDMA standards on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis. We have also informed standards bodies that we hold patents that might be essential for certain standards that are based on OFDMA technology (e.g., 802.16e, 802.16m and LTE (including FDD and TDD versions)) and have committed to offer to license our essential patents for these OFDMA standards on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis. We have made similar commitments with respect to certain other technologies implemented in industry standards.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Our license agreements generally provide us rights to use certain of our licensees’ technology and intellectual property to manufacture and sell certain components (e.g., Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) and related software, subscriber units and/or infrastructure equipment. In most cases, our use of our licensees’ technology and intellectual property does not require us to pay royalties based on the sale of our products. However, under some of the licenses, if we incorporate certain of our licensees’ licensed technology or intellectual property into certain of our products, we are obligated to pay royalties on the sale of such products.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">QSI Segment. <span class="p">QSI makes strategic investments that are focused on opening new or expanding opportunities for our technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services) for voice and data communications. Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries, including, but not limited to, digital media, e-commerce, energy, healthcare and wearable devices. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity instruments, which generally are recorded using the cost method or the equity method, and convertible debt instruments, which are recorded at fair value. QSI also holds wireless spectrum, which at September 28, 2014, consisted of L-Band spectrum in the United Kingdom. As part of our strategic investment activities, we intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future.</span></h1><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Other Businesses. <span class="p">During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we reassessed our management reporting as a result of the sale of the North and Latin America operations of our Omnitracs division, among other reasons. The Omnitracs division was previously aggregated with three other divisions into the Qualcomm Wireless &amp; Internet (QWI) reportable segment. Starting in fiscal 2014, the QWI segment was eliminated, and the former QWI divisions are included in nonreportable segments.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Nonreportable segments include our QMT (Qualcomm MEMS Technologies), Pixtronix and Small Cells divisions and other wireless technology and service initiatives. QMT plans to license its next generation IMOD (interferometric modulator) display technology and to focus on wearable devices.

As a result, QCT has tended historically to have stronger sales toward the end of the calendar year as manufacturers prepare for major holiday selling seasons; and because QTL recognizes royalty revenues when royalties are reported by licensees, QTL has tended to record higher royalty revenues in the first calendar quarter when licensees report their sales made during the fourth calendar quarter. We have also experienced fluctuations in revenues due to the timing of conversions and expansions of 3G and 3G/4G networks by wireless operators and the timing of launches of flagship wireless devices that incorporate our products and/or intellectual property. These trends may or may not continue in the future.</span></h1><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Acquisitions. <span class="p">During fiscal 2014, we acquired 11 businesses for total cash consideration of $775 million. In October 2014, we announced that we had reached agreement with CSR plc on the terms of a recommended cash offer to acquire the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of CSR for £9.00 per ordinary share, which values the entire issued and to be issued share capital of CSR at approximately £1.6 billion (approximately $2.5 billion based upon an exchange rate of USD: GBP 1.6057). CSR is an innovator in the development of multifunction semiconductor platforms and technologies for the auto, consumer and voice and music market segments. The acquisition complements our current offerings by adding products, channels and customers in the growth categories of the Internet of Everything and automotive infotainment, accelerating our presence and path to leadership. The acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including receipt of United States and other regulatory approvals and the approval of CSR’s shareholders. Subject to the satisfaction of these conditions, the acquisition is expected to close by the end of the summer of 2015. We expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions, the amounts of which could vary significantly, to open new opportunities for our technologies, obtain development resources, grow our patent portfolio and/or pursue new businesses.</span></h1><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Discontinued Operations. <span class="p">On November 25, 2013, we completed our sale of the North and Latin America operations of our Omnitracs division to a U.S.-based private equity firm for cash consideration of $788 million (net of cash sold). As a result, we recorded a gain in discontinued operations of $665 million ($430 million net of income tax expense) during fiscal 2014. The revenues and operating results of the North and Latin America operations of our Omnitracs division, which comprised substantially all of our Omnitracs division, were not presented as discontinued operations in any fiscal period because they were immaterial.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Additional information regarding our operating segments is provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8.

Competition in the communications industry throughout the world continues to increase at a rapid pace as consumers, businesses and governments realize the potential of wireless communications products and services. We have facilitated competition in the wireless communications industry by licensing our technologies to, and therefore enabling, a large number of manufacturers. Although we have attained a significant position in the industry, many of our current and potential competitors may have advantages over us, which include, among others: lower cost structures; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to find alternate suppliers or choose alternate technologies; foreign government support of other technologies or our competitors; more extensive relationships with local distribution and original equipment manufacturer companies in emerging geographic regions (such as China); and/or a more established presence in certain device markets. These relationships may affect customers’ decisions to purchase products or license technology from us. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market positions to our detriment.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their product offerings and introduce new technologies and services in the future and as additional companies compete with our products or services based on 3G, 4G or other technologies. Although we intend to continue to make substantial investments in developing new products and technologies and improving existing products and technologies, our competitors may introduce alternative products, services or technologies that threaten our business. It is also possible that the prices we charge for our products and services may continue to decline as competition continues to intensify.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Corporate Responsibility</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">We strive to better our local and global communities through ethical business practices, socially empowering technology applications, educational and environmental programs and employee diversity and volunteerism.</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s2" style="display: inline;">Our Governance. <span class="p">We aim to demonstrate accountability, transparency, integrity and ethical business practices throughout our operations and interactions with our stakeholders.</span></p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s2" style="display: inline;">Our Products. <span class="p">We strive to meet or exceed industry standards for product responsibility and supplier management.</span></p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s2" style="display: inline;">Our Workplace. <span class="p">We endeavor to provide a safe and healthy work environment where diversity is embraced and various opportunities for training, growth and advancement are strongly encouraged for all employees.</span></p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s2" style="display: inline;">Our Community. <span class="p">We have strategic relationships with a wide range of local organizations and programs that develop and strengthen communities worldwide.</span></p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s2" style="display: inline;">Our Environment. <span class="p">We aim to expand our operations while minimizing our carbon footprint, conserving water and reducing waste.</span></p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s2" style="display: inline;">Wireless Reach. <span class="p">We invest in strategic projects that foster entrepreneurship, aid in public safety, enhance delivery of health care, enrich teaching and learning and improve environmental sustainability through the use of advanced wireless technologies.</span></p></li></ul></li></ol></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">At September 28, 2014, we employed approximately 31,300 full-time, part-time and temporary employees.
