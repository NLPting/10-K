In 1991, we reincorporated in the state of Delaware. We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending the last Sunday in September. Our 52-week fiscal years consist of four equal quarters of 13 weeks each, and our 53-week fiscal years consist of three 13-week fiscal quarters and one 14-week fiscal quarter. The financial results for our 53-week fiscal years and our 14-week fiscal quarters will not be exactly comparable to our 52-week fiscal years and our 13-week fiscal quarters. The fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 included 53 weeks. The fiscal years endedSeptember 25, 2011 and September 26, 2010 both included 52 weeks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Overview</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: left;">In 1989, we publicly introduced the concept that a digital communication technique called CDMA could be commercially successful in cellular wireless communication applications. CDMA stands for Code Division Multiple Access and is one of the main technologies currently used in digital wireless communications networks (also known as wireless networks). CDMA and TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), of which Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is the primary commercial form, are the primary digital technologies currently used to transmit a wireless device user’s voice or data over radio waves using a public cellular wireless network. Because we led, and continue to lead, the development and commercialization of CDMA technology, we own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and trade secrets, which applies to all versions of CDMA that we implement in our own products and portions of which we license to other companies. The wireless communications industry generally recognizes that a company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell products that use CDMA technology will require a patent license from us.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: left;">We also continue our leading role in the development and commercialization of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)-based technologies for which we have substantial intellectual property. Sales of multimode CDMA and LTE (which stands for &quot;Long Term Evolution&quot; and is an OFDMA-based standard for cellular wireless communication applications) subscriber devices have grown significantly during the past year. Our CDMA licensees’ sales of such multimode CDMA and OFDMA devices are covered by their existing CDMA license agreements with us. We have also licensed companies to make and sell OFDMA products that do not also implement CDMA, and more than 30 companies (including LG, Nokia and Samsung) have royalty-bearing licenses under all or a portion of our patent portfolio for use in such OFDMA single-mode products.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our Revenues<span class="s2">. </span><span class="p">We generate revenues by selling products and services, which include:</span></h1><ul id="l1"><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">integrated circuits (also known as chips or chipsets) and Radio Frequency (RF) and Power Management (PM) chips and system software used in mobile devices and in wireless networks;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">integrated circuits for use in wired devices, particularly broadband gateway equipment, desktop computers, televisions and Blu-ray players;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012/Image_001.png"/></span></p></li><li style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">equipment, software and services used by companies, including those in the transportation industry and governments, to wirelessly manage their assets and workforce;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">software products and services for content enablement across a wide variety of platforms and devices for the wireless industry;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">software products and services that enable mobile commerce services; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">software and hardware development services.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: left;">We also generate revenues by licensing portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: left;">Our Integrated Circuits Business. <span class="p">We develop and supply integrated circuits and system software based on CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies for use in voice and data communications, networking, application processing, multimedia and global positioning system products.

According to Wireless Intelligence estimates as of November 5, 2012, the number of worldwide mobile connections is expected to reach approximately 6.6 billion by the end of 2012 and approximately 8.3 billion by 2016. Growth in the early days of wireless communications was driven by the need to make voice calls in a mobile environment. More recently, increases in demand are primarily driven by the desire to have access to high-speed data services in a mobile environment. This is evidenced by the widespread deployments of 3G (third generation) across the globe and strong traction for 4G (fourth generation). Each generation has enabled successively higher data transmission rates. According to Wireless Intelligence estimates, the number of global 3G/4G connections reached 1.9 billion and is expected to reach approximately 4.0 billion in 2016. (3G/4G includes 3G, 4G and multimode 3G/4G technologies.) There are several drivers for the growth in 3G/4G, including but not limited to:</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">consumer awareness and desire for data services;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">consumer demand for data-centric smartphone devices;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">emergence of new data devices;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">mature 3G networks with high data rates;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">deployments of higher-data rate 4G in developed regions; and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">growth of 3G in emerging regions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The last few years have witnessed a significant increase in the consumer’s awareness and willingness to use mobile data services. Applications such as email, access to the mobile Internet, downloading of videos and social networking are driving the demand for 3G/4G services and more capable devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">According to reports from the CDMA Development Group and the Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA), as of November 2012, approximately 800 wireless networks now support 3G globally, a sign that wireless operators are making network investments to address the growing demand for wireless data. Wireless operators are continuing to make network investments by upgrading their networks. According to GSA, all of the global WCDMA operators have upgraded their networks to offer High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) services, and 50% of HSPA operators have launched HSPA+, an evolution of HSPA. GSA also reports that more than 110 commercial networks support 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution). With support for higher data rates and increased capacity, networks are expected to evolve to keep up with the growing demand for wireless data.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The mobile Internet is helping increase demand for 3G/4G smartphones as the ability to access data is simplified and enhanced when using a smartphone. In the early days of the smartphone, these devices were designed primarily for high-end business users. However, innovation and competition are helping to make available a broader set of devices that provide compelling user experiences at consumer acceptable price points, which make such devices more accessible by a larger portion of the subscriber base.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The need to stay connected anywhere, anytime is helping drive demand for data connectivity on notebook and netbook computers with either embedded 3G/4G connectivity or via an external 3G/4G USB modem. New device categories, such as tablets and e-readers, have also emerged over the last few years. These new devices take advantage of the capabilities of 3G/4G networks to browse the mobile Internet, and download applications, digital books, newspapers and magazines anywhere.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other emerging device categories, such as machine-to-machine communication (allowing both wireless and wired systems to communicate with other devices), gaming consoles and other consumer electronic devices, are also expected to help further drive global demand for 3G/4G.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Demand for wireless voice and data services in emerging regions is driving the rapid transition from 2G (second generation) to 3G. 3G network technology provides an efficient way for wireless operators to offer both voice and data services to address these demands, and since fixed broadband penetration is very low in these regions, 3G presents a cost effective means of providing broadband capabilities to consumers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wireless Technologies</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The significant growth in the use of wireless devices worldwide, such as smartphones and tablets, and demand for data services and applications requires constant innovation to further improve the user experience, expand capacity and enable dense deployments of low power nodes, such as picocells and femtocells. To meet these requirements, progressive generations of wireless communications technology standards have evolved. The wireless standards used for mobile communications within individual countries are generally determined by the telecommunication service providers operating in those countries and, in some instances, local government regulations. Such determinations are typically based on economic criteria and the service</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">3</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012/Image_003.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">provider’s evaluation of each technology’s ability to provide the features and functionality required for its business plan. More than two decades ago, the European Community developed regulations requiring the use of the GSM standard, a TDMA-based, 2G technology. In addition, several versions of CDMA technology were adopted worldwide as public cellular standards. The first version, known as cdmaOne, is a 2G cellular technology that was first commercially deployed in the mid- 1990s. The other subsequent versions of CDMA are referred to as 3G technologies.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: left;">Second Generation. <span class="p">Compared to first generation analog systems, 2G digital technology provided for significantly enhanced efficiency within a fixed spectrum, resulting in greatly increased voice capacity. 2G technologies also enabled numerous enhanced services, such as SMS texting service, but data services were generally limited to low-speed transmission rates. The main 2G digital cellular technologies in use today are called cdmaOne, a form of CDMA and a technology largely developed and patented by us, and GSM, a form of TDMA. Many GSM operators deployed 2G mobile packet data technologies, such as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE) in areas serviced by GSM. According to Wireless Intelligence estimates as of November 5, 2012, there were approximately 4.5 billion 2G connections worldwide, representing approximately 70% of total wireless connections.</span></h1><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: left;">Third Generation. <span class="p">As a result of demand for wireless networks that simultaneously carry both high-speed data and voice traffic, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a standards setting organization, adopted the 3G standard known as IMT-2000, encompassing six terrestrial operating radio interfaces, each of which incorporates our intellectual property. Two are TDMA-based, three are CDMA-based and the other is OFDMA-based. The three CDMA-based 3G technologies are known commonly throughout the wireless industry as:</span></h1></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">CDMA2000, including 1X (including revisions A through E) and 1xEV-DO (EV-DO or Evolution Data Optimized) (including revisions A through C, developed by 3<span class="s3">rd</span><span class="s4"> </span>Generation Partnership Project Two (3GPP2)) (all of these use the Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) method);</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Wideband CDMA (WCDMA), also known as Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS), including High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), part of 3<span class="s3">rd</span><span class="s4"> </span>Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Releases 5 and 6, and HSPA+, part of 3GPP Releases 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and beyond (all of these use the FDD method); and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">CDMA Time Division Duplex (TDD), of which there are currently two versions, Time Division Duplex-CDMA (TD-CDMA) and Time Division-Synchronous CDMA (TD-SCDMA). Both are part of the specifications developed by 3GPP.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">According to Wireless Intelligence estimates, there were approximately 1.8 billion 3G worldwide connections, representing approximately 29% of total wireless connections. Some of the advantages of 3G CDMA technology over 2G technologies include increased network capacity, improved user experience, higher capacity for data and faster access to data and higher data throughput rates. CDMA2000 and WCDMA are widely deployed today in wireless networks throughout the world. TD- SCDMA has been deployed in China. EV-DO Revision B in the CDMA2000 family was launched in 2010; Release 7 of HSPA+ was launched in 2009; and Release 8 of HSPA+ was launched in 2010. HSPA+ continues to evolve, even as 4G technologies are beginning to be deployed. HSPA+ Release 8 introduced multicarrier operation, which aggregates multiple channels to offer wider bandwidths, supporting 10 MHz of bandwidth in Release 8 and up to 40 MHz in Release 11. 3GPP is making plans to develop specifications for Release 12. There have been widespread developments of Release 8 networks around the world in 2011 and 2012. The various revisions of the 3G CDMA specifications have significantly increased network performance capacity and data speeds. It is expected that future revisions of the 3G CDMA specifications will provide further enhancements.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">CDMA2000 (1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A/B) networks are deployed by wireless operators that support both voice and a wide range of high-speed wireless data services. Enhancements based upon CDMA2000 Revision E Standard, called 1X Advanced, further increases voice capacity of CDMA2000 1X networks. The standardization for 1X Advanced is complete, devices supporting the technology are available and network deployments are in process. Another set of enhancements based upon 1xEV-DO Revision C, also called DO Advanced, improve the performance of 1xEV-DO Revision A/B networks. The first phase of DO Advanced is deployed in commercial networks. Enhancements based upon these updated standards and improved implementations have been and will continue to be deployed in our products and wireless networks to increase capacity and data rates.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">GSM operators around the world, including those in the European Community and in the United States, have focused primarily on the UMTS Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) radio interface of the IMT-2000 standard, known as WCDMA, for their network evolution. WCDMA is based on our CDMA technology and incorporates many of our patented inventions (as do all of the CDMA and OFDMA radio interfaces of the IMT-2000 standard). The majority of the world’s wireless device and infrastructure manufacturers (more than 145 and including all leading suppliers) have licensed our technology for use in WCDMA products, enabling them to utilize this WCDMA mode of the 3G standards.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">The three ITU 3G CDMA radio interfaces are all based on the core principles of CDMA technology, and our intellectual property rights include a valuable patent portfolio essential to implementation of each of the 3G CDMA standards. In addition,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">4</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012/Image_004.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">our patent portfolio includes technologies that contribute to commercially successful product implementations. Generally, we have licensed substantially all of our relevant patents to our CDMA subscriber and infrastructure equipment licensees.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">These 3G CDMA versions (CDMA2000, WCDMA and TD-SCDMA) require separate implementations that are not interchangeable. While the fundamental core technologies are derived from CDMA and, in addition to other features and functionality, are covered by our patents, their specifications each require unique infrastructure products, network design, air interface protocols and management. However, subscriber roaming amongst systems using different air interfaces is made possible through multimode wireless subscriber devices.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Fourth Generation. <span class="p">Release 10 of 3GPP’s Long Term Evolution (LTE), the predominant global OFDMA-based standard, and 802.16m, an upgrade of IEEE 802.16e (WiMAX or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), have both been approved by the ITU to become what are called IMT-Advanced technologies. Release 10 of LTE and WiMAX 802.16m support additional features, wider bandwidths and higher data rates than previous versions of these OFDMA air interfaces, which are part of IMT-2000. There is no uniform industry agreement on the 4G definition; 4G is now broadly used to include OFDMA technologies that are part of the ITU’s IMT (IMT-2000 and IMT-Advanced) standards and has also been used in marketing campaigns by certain carriers for the 3G WCDMA evolution to HSPA+.</span></h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since LTE typically will be overlaid over existing 3G networks, seamless interoperability with 3G (including all CDMA-based 3G technologies) has been standardized by 3GPP and 3GPP2. The first deployments of LTE have been based on Release 8, formally a part of the 3G IMT-2000 standard. According to Wireless Intelligence estimates, the total number of global 4G LTE connections reached approximately 40 million and is expected to reach approximately 560 million in 2016.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">WiMAX 802.16e was deployed ahead of LTE and targeted unpaired spectrum using a TDD radio interface. LTE supports both paired spectrum, using LTE FDD, and unpaired spectrum, using LTE TDD, and is able to address many of the unpaired spectrum bands targeted by WiMAX. Compared to WiMAX, LTE is expected to achieve greater economy of scale through its interoperability with 3G. Certain wireless operators have selected WiMAX because of regulatory considerations specific to their networks and spectrum holdings. Many WiMAX operators have announced that they are planning to move to LTE TDD.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">For over ten years, we have pursued research and development of OFDMA-based wireless communication technologies, and, as a result, have developed and acquired significant related intellectual property. Accordingly, we believe that each of the OFDMA-based 4G standards incorporates our patented technologies. More than 30 companies (including LG, Nokia and Samsung) have entered into royalty-bearing license agreements under our patent portfolio for use in OFDMA products that do not also implement CDMA-based standards. Multimode products that implement both OFDMA and CDMA technologies will, in most cases, be licensed under our existing CDMA license agreements.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: left;">Our Engineering Resources. <span class="p">We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in CDMA, OFDMA and a broad range of other technologies.

QCT competes worldwide with a number of United States and international designers and manufacturers of semiconductors. As a result of global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, technological changes and the potential for further industry consolidation, we anticipate the market to remain very competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors for our products may include performance, level of integration, quality, compliance with industry standards, price, time-to-market, system cost, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation and customer support. We also compete in both single- and dual-mode environments against alternative communications technologies including but not limited to, GSM/GPRS/EDGE, TDMA, TD-SCDMA and WiMAX.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">QCT’s current competitors include, but are not limited to, major companies such as Broadcom, CSR plc, Freescale, HiSilicon Technologies, Intel, Lantiq, Marvell Technology, MediaTek, nVidia, Renesas Electronics, Spreadtrum Communications, ST-Ericsson (a joint venture between Ericsson Mobile Platforms and ST-NXP Wireless), Texas Instruments and VIA Telecom, as well as major communications equipment companies such as Matsushita, Motorola Mobility and Samsung, who design at least some of their own integrated circuits and software for certain products. QCT also faces competition from some early-stage companies. Our competitors devote significant amounts of their financial, technical and other resources to develop and market competitive products and, in some cases, to develop and adopt competitive digital cellular technologies, and those efforts may materially and adversely affect QCT. Moreover, competitors may offer more attractive product pricing or financing terms or have a more established presence in certain device markets or emerging geographic regions than we do as a means of gaining access to the market or customers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">7</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012/Image_007.png"/></span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: left;">QTL Segment. <span class="p">QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD (including TD-SCDMA), GSM/GPRS/EDGE, LTE and/or WiMAX standards and their derivatives. QTL licensing revenues are comprised of license fees as well as royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (e.g., certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT, etc.). Revenues generated from royalties are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations. QTL revenues comprised 33%, 36% and 33% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: left;">Separate and apart from licensing manufacturers of subscriber and network equipment, we have entered into certain patent arrangements with competitors of our QCT segment, such as Broadcom, Fujitsu, MediaTek, NEC, Renesas Electronics, Texas Instruments and VIA Telecom. The purpose of these arrangements is to provide our QCT segment and the counterparties certain freedom of operation with respect to each party’s integrated circuits business. In every case, these agreements expressly reserve the right for QTL to seek royalties from the customers of such integrated circuit suppliers with respect to such suppliers’ customers’ sales of CDMA-, WCDMA- and OFDMA-based wireless devices into which such suppliers’ integrated circuits are incorporated.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">We face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless communications technology and services. On a worldwide basis, we currently compete primarily with the GSM/GPRS/EDGE digital wireless communications technologies. GSM has been utilized extensively in Europe, much of Asia other than Japan and South Korea, and certain other countries. To date, GSM has been more widely adopted than CDMA; however, CDMA technologies have</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">been adopted for all 3G wireless systems. In addition, most GSM operators have deployed GPRS, a packet data technology, as a 2G bridge technology, and a number of GSM operators have deployed EDGE. However, the majority of GSM operators have already augmented their networks with 3G WCDMA and HSPA. According to GSA, as of November 2012, more than 110 wireless operators have commercially deployed and other wireless operators have started testing OFDMA technology (e.g., LTE, WiMAX), a multi-carrier transmission technique not based on CDMA technology, which divides the available spectrum into many carriers, with each carrier being modulated at a low data rate relative to the combined rate for all carriers. According to GSA, more than 300 wireless operators have committed to deploy LTE networks, an OFDMA-based standard. We have invested in both the acquisition and the development of OFDMA technology and intellectual property. We expect that upon the deployment of OFDMA-based networks, the products implementing such technologies generally will be multimode and will also implement CDMA-based technologies. The licenses granted under our existing CDMA license agreements generally cover multimode CDMA/OFDMA devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay royalties under their CDMA license agreements for such devices. Further, over 30 companies (including LG, Nokia and Samsung) have royalty-bearing licenses under our patent portfolio for use in single-mode OFDMA products (which do not implement any CDMA-based standards).</p><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: left;">QWI Segment. <span class="p">QWI revenues comprised 3%, 4% and 6% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

QES provides equipment, software and services to enable companies to wirelessly manage their assets and workforce. QES offers satellite- and terrestrial-based two-way wireless connectivity and position location services to transportation and logistics fleets that permit customers to track the location and monitor performance of their assets, communicate with their personnel and collect data. The QES division markets and sells products through a sales force, partnerships and distributors based in the United States, Europe, Latin America and Canada. Wireless transmissions and position tracking for satellite-based systems are provided by using leased transponders on commercially available geostationary Earth orbit satellites. The terrestrial-based systems use wireless digital and analog terrestrial networks for information transmission and the global positioning system constellation for position tracking.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Existing competitors of our QES division offering alternatives to our products are aggressively pricing their products and services and could continue to do so in the future. We face several key competitors to our satellite- and terrestrial-based mobile fleet management and asset tracking products and services both domestically and internationally. These competitors are offering new value-added products and services similar in many cases to our existing or developing technologies. Emergence of new competitors, particularly those offering low-cost terrestrial-based products and satellite-based products, may adversely impact our margins and intensify competition in new regions. Similarly, some original equipment manufacturers of trucks and truck components are beginning to offer built-in, on-board fleet management and position location reporting systems that may adversely impact our margins and intensify competition for existing and new customers.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: left;">QIS Division. <span class="p">QIS provides software products and content enablement services to wireless operators worldwide to support and accelerate the growth and advancement of wireless data products and services.

QMT’s IMOD display technology, based on a MEMS structure combined with thin film optics, is intended to provide performance and power consumption benefits as compared to other display technologies. As displays in all types of mobile devices trend toward higher performance, pixel density, power consumption and outdoor viewability continue to be significant factors to overall display performance. We believe IMOD displays can provide a competitive advantage in these areas. In fiscal 2011, we initiated construction of a manufacturing facility in Taiwan for IMOD displays with the initial phase expected to be completed in early fiscal 2013. We are evaluating strategic options for this new manufacturing facility, which include, but are not limited to, operating the facility in support of our commercialization efforts and/or a sale to, or joint venture with, a third party.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: left;">Additional information regarding our operating segments is provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report in &quot;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8.

Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated. The changes in our corporate structure generally formalize the way we have historically operated our primary businesses. The changes have been implemented, among other reasons, in order to enhance our ability to quickly deliver products to our customers and to assist our products and services businesses to fully participate in the sectors in which they operate, including in their development, use and distribution of software received pursuant to open source software licenses, while further protecting and insulating our valuable patent portfolio.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and develop new products and technologies. Our research and development team has a demonstrated track record of innovation in voice and data communication technologies. Our research and development expenditures in fiscal 2012,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012/Image_009.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2011 and 2010 totaled approximately $3.9 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, and as a result, we continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio. Research and development expenditures were primarily related to the development of integrated circuit products, next generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services, including lower cost devices, the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, third-party operating systems and services platforms. The technologies supporting these initiatives may include CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A, EV-DO Revision B, 1x Advanced, WCDMA, HSDPA, HSUPA, HSPA+, TD-SCDMA, LTE and TD-LTE. Research and development expenditures were also incurred related to the development of IMOD and other display technologies, Plaza products and other technologies.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">We have research and development centers in various locations throughout the world that support our global development activities and ongoing efforts to advance CDMA, OFDMA and a broad range of other technologies. We continue to use our substantial engineering resources and expertise to develop new technologies, applications and services and make them available to licensees to help grow the communications industry and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities. In addition to internally sponsored research and development, we perform contract research and development for various government agencies and commercial contractors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales and Marketing</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Sales and marketing activities of our operating segments are discussed under Operating Segments. Other marketing activities include public relations, advertising, web-marketing, participation in technical conferences and trade shows, development of business cases and white papers, competitive analyses, industry intelligence and other marketing programs, such as marketing development funds with our customers. Our Corporate Marketing department provides company information on our internet site and through other media regarding our products, strategies and technology to industry analysts and for publications.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Competition to our operating segments is discussed under Operating Segments. Competition in the communications industry throughout the world continues to increase at a rapid pace as consumers, businesses and governments realize the potential of wireless communications products and services. We have facilitated competition in the wireless communications industry by licensing and enabling a large number of manufacturers. Although we have attained a significant position in the industry, many of our current and potential competitors may have advantages over us, which include, among others, motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to find alternate suppliers or choose alternate technologies and foreign government support of other technologies (e.g., GSM) or our competitors. In addition, our competitors may have established more extensive relationships with local distribution and original equipment manufacturer companies in emerging geographic regions (e.g., China) or a more established presence in certain device markets. These relationships may affect customers’ decisions to purchase products or license technology from us. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market positions to our detriment.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">We expect to continue to face competition throughout the world as new technologies and services are introduced in the future and as additional companies compete with our products or services based on 3G, 4G or other technologies. Although we intend to continue to make substantial investments in developing improvements to existing and new products and technologies, our competitors may introduce alternative products, services or technologies that threaten our business. It is also possible that the price we charge for our products and services may continue to decline as competition continues to intensify.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and proprietary information to maintain and enhance our competitive position. We have an extensive portfolio of United States and foreign patents, and we continue to pursue patent applications around the world. Our patents have broad coverage in many countries, including China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, Brazil, India, Taiwan and elsewhere. A substantial portion of our patents and patent applications relate to digital wireless communications technologies, including patents that are essential or may be important to the commercial implementation of CDMA2000, WCDMA (UMTS), TD-SCDMA, TD-CDMA and OFDMA products.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Standards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G standards that are based on CDMA. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to license our essential patents for these CDMA standards on a fair and reasonable basis free from unfair discrimination. We have also informed standards bodies that we hold patents that might be essential for certain standards that are based on OFDMA technology (e.g., 802.16e, 802.16m and LTE (including FDD and TDD versions)) and have committed to offer to license our essential patents for these OFDMA standards on a fair and reasonable basis free from unfair discrimination.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 254pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">10</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012/Image_010.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Since our founding in 1985, we have focused heavily on technology development and innovation. These efforts have resulted in a leading intellectual property portfolio related to, among other things, wireless technology. Because all commercially deployed forms of CDMA and their derivatives require the use of our patents, our patent portfolio is the most widely and extensively licensed portfolio in the industry with over 220 licensees. Over the years a number of companies have challenged our patent position but at this time most, if not all, companies in the industry recognize that any company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell products that use CDMA technologies will require a license or other rights to use our patents.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">As part of our strategy to generate licensing revenues that continue to support our research and development investments and support worldwide adoption of our CDMA technology, we provide rights to design, manufacture and sell products utilizing certain portions of our intellectual property to other companies, including those companies listed on our Internet site (www.qualcomm.com).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">We have licensed or otherwise provided rights to use our patented technologies to interested companies on terms that are fair, reasonable and free from unfair discrimination. Unlike some other companies in our industry that hold back certain key technologies, we offer interested companies essentially our entire patent</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">portfolio for use in cellular subscriber devices and cell site infrastructure equipment. Our strategy to make our patented technologies broadly available has been a catalyst for industry growth, helping to enable a wide range of companies offering a broad array of wireless products and features while driving down average and low-end selling prices for 3G handsets and other wireless devices. By licensing or otherwise providing rights to use our patented technologies to a wide range of equipment manufacturers, encouraging innovative applications, supporting equipment manufacturers with integrated chipset and software products, and focusing on improving the efficiency of the airlink for wireless operators, we have helped 3G CDMA evolve, grow and reduce device pricing all at a faster pace than the second generation technologies that preceded it (e.g., GSM).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">Under our subscriber unit, infrastructure equipment and test equipment license agreements, licensees are generally required to pay us a fixed license fee as well as ongoing royalties based on a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price, net of certain permissible deductions (e.g., certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT, etc.), of each licensed product and/or a fixed per unit amount. License fees are paid in one or more installments, while royalties generally are payable based on sales throughout the life of the licensed patents. Our licensing terms are reasonable and fair to the companies that benefit from our intellectual property and provide significant incentives for others to invest in CDMA applications, as evidenced by the significant growth in the CDMA portion of the wireless industry and the number of CDMA participants. Our license agreements generally provide us rights to use certain of our licensees’ technology and intellectual property rights to manufacture and sell certain components (e.g., Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) and related software, subscriber units and/or infrastructure equipment. In most cases, our use of our licensees’ technology and intellectual property does not require us to pay royalties based on the sale of our products. However, under some of the licenses, if we incorporate certain of our licenses’ licensed technology or intellectual property into certain of our products, we are obligated to pay royalties on the sale of such products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Corporate Responsibility</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">At Qualcomm, we realize that we have a significant role to play as we strive to better our local and global communities through ethical business practices, socially empowering technology applications, educational and environmental programs and employee diversity and volunteerism.</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s2" style="display: inline;">Our Company. <span class="p">We strive to meet and exceed industry standards for ethical business practices, product responsibility, and supplier management.</span></p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s2" style="display: inline;">Our Environment. <span class="p">We aim to grow our operations while minimizing our carbon footprint, conserving water and reducing waste.</span></p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s2" style="display: inline;">Our Community. <span class="p">We are committed to growing strategic relationships with a wide range of local organizations and programs that develop and strengthen communities worldwide.</span></p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s2" style="display: inline;">Our Workplace. <span class="p">We provide a safe and healthy work environment where diversity is embraced and various opportunities for training, growth, and advancement are strongly encouraged for all employees.</span></p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s2" style="display: inline;">Wireless Reach. <span class="p">We invest in projects that foster entrepreneurship, aid in public safety, enhance delivery of health care, enrich teaching and learning and improve environmental sustainability through the use of 3G and next-generation technologies.</span></p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: left;">At September 30, 2012, we employed approximately 26,600 full-time, part-time and temporary employees.
