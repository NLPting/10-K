Our extensive portfolio of power and signal management, logic, discrete and custom devices helps customers efficiently solve their design challenges in advanced electronic systems and products. Our power management and motor driver semiconductor components control, convert, protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices. Our custom ASICs use analog, DSP, mixed-signal and advanced logic capabilities to act as the brain behind many of our automotive, medical, military/aerospace, consumer and industrial customers’ products. Our data management semiconductor components provide high-performance clock management and data flow management for precision computing, communications and industrial systems. Our image sensors, optical image stabilization and auto focus devices provide advanced imaging solutions for optical systems. Our standard semiconductor components serve as “building blocks” within virtually all types of electronic devices. These various products fall into the logic, analog, discrete, image sensors and memory categories used by the WSTS group.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We serve a broad base of end-user markets, including automotive, communications, computing, consumer electronics, medical, industrial, smart grid and military/aerospace. Our devices are found in a wide variety of end-products including automotive electronics, smartphones, media tablets, wearable electronics, computers, servers, industrial building and home automation systems, consumer white goods, LED lighting, power supplies, networking and telecom equipment, medical diagnostics, imaging and hearing health, and sensor networks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our portfolio of devices enables us to offer advanced ICs and the “building block” components that deliver system level functionality and design solutions. Our extensive product portfolio consisted of approximately 46,000 products in 2013 and we shipped approximately 42.4 billion units in 2013 as compared to 37.1 billion units in 2012. We offer micro packages, which provide increased performance characteristics while reducing the critical board space inside today’s ever shrinking electronic devices and power modules, delivering improved energy efficiency and reliability for a wide variety of high power applications. We believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products, combined with our global manufacturing and logistics network, provides our customers with single source purchasing on a cost-effective and timely basis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We are currently organized into three operating segments, which also represent three reporting segments: Application Products Group, Standard Products Group, and System Solutions Group (formerly referred to as the “SANYO Semiconductor Products Group”). Our System Solutions Group was acquired on January 1, 2011 from SANYO Electric, and designs, manufactures and sells discrete components, hybrid ICs, radio frequency and power related products as well as custom ICs. Many of these devices fall into the existing product categories described above. However, the addition of our System Solutions Group operating segment expanded our capability in microcontrollers and optical imaging (including auto-focus and image stabilization for smartphones and media tablets), and extended our custom ASICs to integrated power modules and motor control devices for the consumer, automotive and industrial end-markets. Each of our major product lines has been assigned to a segment, as illustrated in the table below, based on our operating strategy. From time to time we reassess the alignment of our product families and devices to our operating segments and may move product families or individual devices from one operating segment to another.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">4</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:5.80134pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:8pt"><td style="width:131pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt"><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;">Application Products Group</p></td><td style="width:206pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt"><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;">Standard Products Group</p></td><td style="width:142pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt"><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;">System Solutions Group</p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:131pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Automotive ASSPs</p></td><td style="width:206pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Bipolar Power</p></td><td style="width:142pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Power MOSFETs</p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:131pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Analog Automotive</p></td><td style="width:206pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Thyristor</p></td><td style="width:142pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">IGBTs</p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:131pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Automotive Power Switching</p></td><td style="width:206pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Small Signal</p></td><td style="width:142pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Power and Signal Discretes</p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:131pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Automotive Mixed-Signal solutions</p></td><td style="width:206pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Zener</p></td><td style="width:142pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Intelligent Power Modules</p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:131pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Medical ASICs &amp;

On August 4, 1999, we were recapitalized (the “recapitalization”) and certain related transactions were effected pursuant to an agreement among us, our principal domestic operating subsidiary, SCI LLC, Motorola and affiliates of Texas Pacific Group (“TPG”). During 2007, TPG sold all of its remaining shares of our common stock to multiple buyers and ceased being our principal stockholder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">5</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Recent Company Mergers and Acquisitions</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have historically pursued strategic acquisitions to leverage our existing capabilities and further build our business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">On January 1, 2011, we paid SANYO Electric $142.1 million in cash and issued a $377.5 million note payable to SANYO Electric, through SCI LLC, in exchange for a 100% interest in SANYO Semiconductor and certain other semiconductor related assets held by SANYO Electric. In the second quarter of 2011, we received approximately $39.7 million in cash from SANYO Electric for working capital and pension adjustments as determined in accordance with the purchase agreement, which resulted in a net purchase price of $479.9 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The acquisition of SANYO Semiconductor provided us with a stronger market presence in Japan, with many leading Japan-based customers, some of which were previously our customers. We believe that this acquisition has provided and will continue to provide us with access to market-leading Japanese and Asian customers, while providing our System Solutions Group’s customers with access to advanced front-end mixed-signal and analog manufacturing, and ultra high volume back-end facilities. Since acquiring SANYO Semiconductor in 2011, we have incurred material restructuring expenses to achieve cost savings in order to align the System Solutions Group’s cost structure with expected revenue levels as the System Solutions Group experienced revenue and financial performance declines which were greater than our expectations and greater then cyclical declines in our other operating segments. These revenue declines were at least partially attributable to the impact from the October 2011 Thailand flood, a softening of the Japanese consumer market and, to a lesser extent, political tensions between Japan and China. See Part II,</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations” under the heading “Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other, Net” included elsewhere in this report for additional information on our System Solutions Group restructuring activities. On a long-term basis, we expect our System Solutions Group to benefit from access to ON Semiconductor’s market leading customers not previously doing business with SANYO Semiconductor in North America, Europe and China.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">On February 27, 2011, we acquired 100% of the CMOS ISBU from Cypress Semiconductor for $34.1 million in cash. The ISBU includes a broad portfolio of high-performance custom and standard image sensors used in multi-megapixel machine vision, linear and two dimensional (2D) bar code imaging, medical x-ray imaging, biometrics, digital photography and cinematography, and aerospace applications. The acquired products include the VITA, LUPA, STAR, and IBIS families, which are all well known throughout the industry.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">During 2010, we acquired 100% of SDT and CMD in all cash transactions. During 2009, we acquired 100% of PulseCore in an all cash transaction.

Our investment in Leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements. Our joint venture partner, Leshan</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">11</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Radio Company Ltd., is formerly a state-owned enterprise. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement, requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of Leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture. Each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder, provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity (which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity) in lieu of satisfying the commitment. We committed to purchase 70% of Leshan’s production capacity in 2013, 70% in 2012, 70% in 2011 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 70% of Leshan’s expected production capacity in 2014.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We use third-party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities, primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods. Our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts. In some cases, longer-term commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship. These contract manufacturers, including Amkor, ASE, GRACE/HHNEC, UMC and UTAC, accounted for approximately 26%, 23% and 23% of our manufacturing costs in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">For information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” under the heading “Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business” included elsewhere in this report.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Raw Materials</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, gold, copper, and lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. We obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a just-in-time basis, and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our table which shows commitments, contingencies and indemnities in Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” under the heading “Contractual Obligations” included elsewhere in this report. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply, increased demand in the industry or certain other factors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales, Marketing and Distribution</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">As of December 31, 2013, our global sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 1,100 professionals, servicing customers in approximately 70 countries. We support our customers through logistics organizations and just-in-time warehouses. Global and regional distribution channels further support our customers’ needs for quick response and service. We offer efficient, cost-effective global applications support from our Technical Information Centers and Solution Engineering Centers, allowing for applications which are developed in one region of the world to be instantaneously available throughout all other regions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Other Intellectual Property Rights</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We market our products under our registered trademark ON Semiconductor<span class="s12">® </span>and our ON logo. We own rights to a number of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other IP directly related to and important to our business. In connection with our 1999 recapitalization, Motorola assigned, licensed or sublicensed to us, as the case may be, certain IP to support and continue the operation of our business. We also acquired or were licensed or sublicensed to a significant amount of IP, including patents and patent applications, in connection with our acquisition of SANYO Semiconductor. In connection with the IP received from the SANYO Semiconductor transaction, we received a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from general unknown and certain known infringement claims from third parties. As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately 6,200 U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 1,600 patent applications pending worldwide. Our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2014 to 2033. None of our patents that expire in the near future materially affect</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">12</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">our business. Additionally, we have rights to more than 293 registered and common law trademarks. Our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our IP rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents, copyrights and other IP rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seasonality</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Historically, our revenues have been affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related end-markets consisting of a stronger second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year. We have, in the past, experienced substantial quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenues and operating results and, in the future, could continue to experience short-term period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to orders that are predominantly booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery. Generally, prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking. Backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demand from our Electronic Data Interface customers, in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13-week period following such date. Backlog is influenced by several factors, including market demand, pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times. For those shipments to distributors who are allowed sales return rights and allowances, we record revenues on a “sell-through” basis. Thus, backlog comprised of orders from these distributors will not result in revenues until these distributors sell the products ordered. During 2013, our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 82% and 87% of actual revenues during such quarter, which is consistent with backlog levels in recent prior periods. As manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases, customers tend to order products further in advance and, as a result, backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">In the semiconductor industry, backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs. Agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or, as a matter of industry practice, are often not enforced. Therefore, a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable. For these reasons, the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with just-in-time principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products. However, these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The semiconductor industry, particularly the market for general-purpose semiconductor products like ours, is highly competitive. Although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines, we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies, as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. Because our components are often building block semiconductors that, in some cases, can be integrated into more complex ICs, we also face competition from manufacturers of ICs, ASICs and fully customized ICs, as well as customers who develop their own IC products. See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors—Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business” located elsewhere in this report for additional information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">In comparison, several competitors noted below are larger in scale and size, have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">13</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. The following discusses the effects of competition on our three operating segments:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Application Products Group</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The principal methods of competition in the Application Products Group are with other custom semiconductor vendors based on design experience, manufacturing capability, depth and quality of IP, ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product, length of design cycle, longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables, both inside and outside of our control. These variables include, but are not limited to, the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies, product performance and quality, manufacturing yields and availability, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends. Select competitors for certain of our products and solutions include: Elmos Semiconductor AG; Intersil Corporation; Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.; Melexis N.V.; STMicroelectronics N.V.; and Texas Instruments Inc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Standard Products Group</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The Standard Products Group’s competitive strengths are in our market leading protection and filtering products, the breadth of our portfolio, technical performance, micro-packaging expertise, our high quality, low cost structure, and supply chain management which ensures supply to key customers.

During 2013, research and development costs decreased as a result of restructuring activities in our System Solutions Group.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Government Regulation</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites, and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona is located on property that is a “Superfund” site, a property listed on the National Priorities List and subject to clean-up activities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Motorola and now Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (“Freescale”) have been actively involved in the cleanup of on-site solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and off-site contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the State of Arizona. As part of our 1999 recapitalization, Motorola retained responsibility for this contamination and Motorola and Freescale have agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our former manufacturing location in Aizu, Japan is located on property where soil and ground water contamination has been detected. We believe that the contamination originally occurred during a time when the facility was operated by a prior owner. We have been working with local authorities to implement remediation actions and expect all remaining remediation costs to be covered by insurance. Based on information available, any net costs to us in connection with this matter are not expected to be material.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our manufacturing facility in the Czech Republic has ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that this facility was operated by government-owned entities. The remediation project consists primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located on-site and off-site, with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded. The government of the Czech Republic has agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries, subject to specified limitations, for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination. Based upon the information available, we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our design center in East Greenwich, Rhode Island is located on property that has localized soil contamination. When we purchased the East Greenwich facility, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Covenant Not To Sue with the State of Rhode Island. This agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property. Based on the information available, we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">As a result of the acquisition of AMIS in 2008, we are a “primary responsible party” to an environmental remediation and cleanup at AMIS’s former corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Costs incurred by AMIS include implementation of the clean-up plan, operations and maintenance of remediation systems, and other project management costs. However, AMIS’s former parent company, a subsidiary of Nippon Mining contractually agreed to indemnify AMIS and us for any obligation relating to environmental remediation and cleanup at this location. Based on the information available, we do not believe that any future costs to us in connection with this matter will be material.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.
