Our broad portfolio of power and signal management, logic, discrete and custom devices helps customers efficiently solve their design challenges in automotive, communications, computing, consumer, industrial, LED lighting, medical, military/aerospace, smart grid and power applications. We design, manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that address the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products. Our power management semiconductor components control, convert, protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices. Our custom ASICs use analog, DSP, mixed-signal and advanced logic capabilities to act as the brain behind many of our automotive, medical, military/aerospace, consumer and industrial customers’ unique products. Our data management semiconductor components provide high-performance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems. Our standard semiconductor components serve as “building block” components within virtually all types of electronic devices. These various products fall into the logic, analog, discrete, image sensors and memory categories used by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”) group.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">We serve a broad base of end-user markets, including automotive, communications, computing, consumer, medical, industrial, smart grid and military/aerospace. Applications for our products in these markets include portable electronics, computers, game consoles, servers, automotive and industrial control systems, LED lighting, power supplies, networking and telecom gear and automated test equipment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our extensive portfolio of devices enables us to offer advanced ICs and the “building block” components that deliver system level functionality and design solutions. Our product portfolio consisted of approximately 44,000 products in 2012 and we shipped approximately 37.1 billion units in 2012 as compared to 42.6 billion units in 2011. We specialize in micro packages, which offer increased performance characteristics while reducing the critical board space inside today’s ever shrinking electronic devices. We believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products, global manufacturing network and logistics provides our customers with single source purchasing on a cost-effective and timely basis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We announced a change in our organizational structure and the way we report our segment information during the fourth quarter of 2012. Previously reported information has been recast to reflect current organizational structure and reportable segments. We are currently organized into three operating segments, which also represent three reporting segments: Application Products Group, Standard Products Group, and SANYO Semiconductor Products Group. Our SANYO Semiconductor Products Group operating segment, acquired on January 1, 2011, designs, manufactures and sells discrete components, hybrid ICs, radio frequency and power related products as well as custom ICs. Many of these devices fall into the existing product categories described above. However, our SANYO Semiconductor Products Group operating segment expands our capability in microcontrollers, optical imaging (including auto-focus and image stabilization for smartphones and digital cameras), and extends our custom ASICs to integrated power modules and motor control devices for the consumer, automotive and industrial end-markets. Each of our major product lines has been assigned to a segment, as illustrated in the table below, based on our operating strategy. From time to time we reassess the alignment of our product families and devices to our operating segments and may move product families or individual devices from one operating segment to another.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">4</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:5.30134pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:8pt"><td style="width:128pt"><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;">Application Products Group</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="103" height="1" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2013/Image_001.png"/></span></p></td><td style="width:207pt"><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;">Standard Products Group</p><p style="padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="94" height="1" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2013/Image_002.png"/></span></p></td><td style="width:193pt"><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;">SANYO Semiconductor Products Group</p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="148" height="1" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2013/Image_003.png"/></span></p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:128pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">ASSPs</p></td><td style="width:207pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Bipolar Power</p></td><td style="width:193pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Power MOSFETs</p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:128pt"><p class="s3" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Analog Automotive</p></td><td style="width:207pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Thyristor</p></td><td style="width:193pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">IGBTs</p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:128pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Automotive Power Switching</p></td><td style="width:207pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Small Signal</p></td><td style="width:193pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Power and Signal Discretes</p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:128pt"><p class="s3" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Automotive Mixed-Signal solutions</p></td><td style="width:207pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Zener</p></td><td style="width:193pt"><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Intelligent Power Modules</p></td></tr><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:128pt" bgcolor="#CCEDFF"><p class="s3" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">Medical ASICs &amp;

The increase from 2010 to 2011 was driven by the significantly higher mix of OEM revenue from our acquisition of SANYO Semiconductor in 2011. These customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as Continental Automotive Systems, Samsung Electric, Panasonic, Delta, and Hella. We focus on three types of OEMs: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and target market customers. Large multi-nationals and selected regional accounts, which are significant in specific markets, are our core OEM customers. The target market customers in the communications, power management and standard analog and the high frequency clock and data management markets are OEMs that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development. Generally, our OEM customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Distributors <span class="p">Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 38% of our revenues in 2012, 37% of our revenues in 2011 and 45% of our revenues in 2010. The decrease from 2010 to 2011 was driven by significantly lower mix of distributors from our acquisition of SANYO Semiconductor in 2011. Our distributors, which include Avnet, World Peace, OS Electronics, Arrow and WT Microelectronics, resell to mid-sized and smaller OEMs and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies. Sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slow-moving products. Under certain agreements, distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book. In addition, agreements with certain of our distributors contain stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Due to current limitations on the feasibility of estimating the up front effect of returns and allowances with these distributors, we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to these distributors until these distributors resell the product. As a result, sales returns have minimal impact on our results of operations.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s1">Electronic Manufacturing Service Providers </span>Direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 7% of our revenues in 2012, 7% of our revenues in 2011 and 9% of our revenues in 2010. Our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are Flextronics, Jabil, Sanmina, Benchmark Electronic and HK Towada Electronics<i>. </i>These customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for OEMs. Originally, these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards, but they now typically provide design, supply management and manufacturing solutions as well. Many OEMs now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies. We are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace. Generally, our electronic manufacturing service customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">See Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 17: “Segment Information” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for revenues by geographic locations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing Operations</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We operate front-end wafer site facilities located in Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Japan, Malaysia, and the United States, and back-end assembly and test site facilities located in Canada, China, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.

The Aizu Plan was undertaken as part of our overall drive for operational efficiencies and is in line with an ongoing strategy aimed at migrating in- house production to large, high volume facilities, and investing in more advanced wafer technologies.

Under the Thailand Plans, a majority of the Ayutthaya and Bang Pa In production was transferred to other Company-owned facilities and to certain external subcontractors during the year ended December 31, 2012.

In June 2002, we obtained approval from the Chinese government for the Leshan joint venture to invest up to $231.0 million in semiconductor operations, which is in addition to the $278.0 million originally approved. In 2004, we committed to make additional capital contributions of approximately $25.0 million to this joint venture by 2012, subject to market conditions. As of December 31, 2012, we had made additional capital contributions of approximately $28.0 million. We have no obligation to make future capital contributions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We use third-party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities, primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods. Our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts. In some cases, longer-term commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship. These contract manufacturers, including Amkor, UTAC, Unisem, Tower, JCAP, UMC and TSMC, accounted for approximately 23%, 23% and 29% of our manufacturing costs in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Raw Materials</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, gold, copper, and lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. We obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a just-in-time basis, and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our table which shows commitments, contingencies and indemnities in Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Liquidity and Capital Resources” under the heading “Contractual Obligations” included elsewhere in this report. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply, increased demand in the industry or certain other factors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales, Marketing and Distribution</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">As of December 31, 2012, our global sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 1,100 professionals operating out of approximately 50 offices, which serve customers in approximately 70 countries. We support our customers through logistics organizations and just-in-time warehouses. Global and regional distribution channels further support our customers’ needs for quick response and service. We offer efficient, cost-effective Internet-based applications support from our laboratories in Czech Republic, China and the United States. Through on-line connectivity, applications developed in one region of the world are now instantaneously available to all other regions. We continue to monitor our freight and logistical support operations for potential cost savings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Other Intellectual Property Rights</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We market our products under our registered trademark ON Semiconductor<span class="s9">® </span>and our ON logo, as well as under the licensed trademark and logo of SANYO Semiconductor, which we are able to utilize for a three year period from the acquisition date with some extension of time for certain products that are manufactured but not yet sold by the end of 2013. We own rights to a number of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other IP directly related to and important to our business. In connection with our 1999 recapitalization, Motorola</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">14</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">assigned, licensed or sublicensed to us, as the case may be, certain IP to support and continue the operation of our business. We also acquired or were licensed or sublicensed to a significant amount of IP, including patents and patent applications, in connection with our acquisition of SANYO Semiconductor. In connection with the IP received from the SANYO Semiconductor transaction, we received a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from general unknown and certain known infringement claims from third parties. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 6,200 U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 3,000 patent applications pending worldwide. Our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2013 to 2032. None of our patents that expire in the near future materially affect our business. Additionally, we have rights to more than 330 registered and common law trademarks. Our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our IP rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents, copyrights and other IP rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seasonality</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Historically, our revenues have been affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related end-markets consisting of a stronger second half of the year for consumer products as compared to the first half of the year. In 2012, as a result of global and industry economic conditions, we did not experience the traditional cyclical pattern during the second half of the year. In recent years, the industry has also been affected by significant shifts in consumer demand due to economic or other factors, which has resulted in volatility in order patterns and lead times, sudden shifts in product demand and periodic production over- capacity. We have, in the past, experienced substantial quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenues and operating results and, in the future, could continue to experience short term period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to orders that are predominantly booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery. Generally, prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking. Backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demand from our Electronic Data Interface customers, in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13-week period following such date. Backlog is influenced by several factors, including market demand, pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times. For those shipments to distributors who are allowed sales return rights and allowances, we record revenues on a “sell-through” basis. Thus, backlog comprised of orders from these distributors will not result in revenues until these distributors sell the products ordered. During 2012, our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 82% and 92% of actual revenues during such quarter, which is lower on a percentage basis than prior years. This is generally due to the acquisition of SANYO Semiconductor, as that business has a lower backlog as compared to the historical ON Semiconductor business. As manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases, customers tend to order products further in advance and, as a result, backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">In the semiconductor industry, backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs. Agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or, as a matter of industry practice, are often not enforced. Therefore, a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable. For these reasons, the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with just-in-time principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products. However, these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">15</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The semiconductor industry, particularly the market for general-purpose semiconductor products like ours, is highly competitive. Although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines, we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies, as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. Because our components are often building block semiconductors that, in some cases, can be integrated into more complex ICs, we also face competition from manufacturers of ICs, ASICs and fully customized ICs, as well as customers who develop their own IC products. See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors— Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business” located elsewhere in this report for additional information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">In comparison, several competitors noted below are larger in scale and size, have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. The following discusses the effects of competition on our three operating segments:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Application Products Group</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The principal methods of competition in the Application Products Group are with other customer-specific semiconductor vendors based on design experience, manufacturing capability, depth and quality of IP, ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product, length of design cycle, longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">Our ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables, both inside and outside of our control. These variables include, but are not limited to, the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies, product performance and quality, manufacturing yields and availability, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our Medical and Industrial Timing businesses face direct competition from large diversified semiconductor suppliers that supply custom and semi-custom ICs, such as STMicroelectronics N.V. and Texas Instruments Incorporated. The business also faces direct competition from smaller end-market-focused mixed-signal suppliers, such as Elmos Semiconductor and ZMD AG. Direct competition also comes from our target customers themselves, who may have internal IC design resources dedicated to supporting the parent. Our Timing Products business also faces direct competition from clock suppliers such as Cypress Semiconductor and Integrated Device Technology, Inc., and our digital ASIC business faces threats from FPGA vendors such as Xilinx, Inc. and Altera Corporation, as well as digital ASIC suppliers like Open-Silicon, Inc. and e-Silicon Corporation. Our primary foundry competition includes X-FAB Semiconductor Foundries AG, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd., Tower Semiconductor Ltd. and MagnaChip Semiconductor LLC.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We also face indirect competition from ASSP suppliers such as Microchip Technology, Inc., whose mixed-signal microcontroller products capture low-end mixed-signal ASIC opportunities. Indirect competition also comes from analog standard products suppliers such as Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., Analog Devices, Inc. and Linear Technology Corporation, whose technical performance or off-the-shelf availability may be better than what we can offer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The principal methods of competition in the computing and consumer markets are technical performance, total solution cost of ownership, quality and assurance of supply. Our architectures for AC-DC conversion offer a competitive total cost of ownership and leadership in power efficiency to compete. Our architecture for our microprocessor and DDR memory controllers offers a competitive cost of ownership and performance position to compete in the computing and consumer game console market. In addition, the breadth of our portfolio in other support functions such as DC- DC converters, over voltage protection IC’s, video and audio ICs, and standard analog and logic ICs gives us the opportunity to serve multiple requirements and allows customers to control their vendor lists more easily. Our significant competitors in this market include Intersil Corporation, Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., Texas Instruments Incorporated, STMicroelectronics N.V. and Power Integrations, Inc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">16</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Standard Products Group</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The Standard Products Group’s competitive strengths are in our market leading protection and filtering products, the breadth of our portfolio, technical performance, micro-packaging expertise, our high quality, low cost structure, and supply chain management which ensures supply to key customers. In addition, our strengths include our strong IP portfolio and our ability to leverage IP blocks across the Company to develop high value-added ASSPs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The principal methods of competing in our discrete semiconductor products are through new product and package innovations with enhanced performance over existing products. Of particular importance are our transient voltage protection and filtering portfolios (ESD Protection, Common Mode Filters), power switching and rectification products and CCRs, where we enjoy significant performance advantages over our competition. Our significant competitors include Diodes Incorporated, NXP B.V., Rohm Co., Ltd., TSPS Corporation, Infineon Technologies AG, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc., Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc., STMicroelectronics N.V., and Semtech Corporation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SANYO Semiconductor Products Group</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The principal methods of competition for the SANYO Semiconductor Products Group are technical performance, quality, service and price. Our competitive strengths are strong technology and design capability, breadth of product portfolio, systems design expertise and long-standing supply relationships with leading OEM customers. Our significant competitors include Toshiba Corporation, Renasas Electronics Corporation, NXP B.V., Rohm Co. Ltd., Mitsubishi Electric, Sanken Electric, STMicroelectronics N.V., Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc., International Rectifier Corporation and Texas Instruments Incorporated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Company-sponsored research and development costs in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $367.5 million (12.7% of revenue), $362.5 million (10.5% of revenue) and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$248.0 million (10.7% of revenue), respectively. Our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications. During 2012, research and development costs increased as a result of our growing usage of engineering materials and depreciation for new capital projects and design software.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Government Regulation</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites, and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona is located on property that is a “Superfund” site, a property listed on the National Priorities List and subject to clean-up activities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Motorola and now Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (“Freescale”) have been actively involved in the cleanup of on-site solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and off-site contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the State of Arizona. As part of our 1999 recapitalization, Motorola retained responsibility for this contamination and Motorola and Freescale have agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our former manufacturing location in Aizu, Japan is located on property where soil and ground water contamination has been detected. We believe that the contamination originally occurred during a time when the facility was operated by a prior owner. We are working with local authorities to determine the appropriate</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">17</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">remediation actions and expect remediation costs, subject to certain limitations, to be indemnified pursuant to an agreement between us and the prior owner or covered by insurance subject to a deductible. Based on information available, any net costs to us in connection with this matter are not expected to be material.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our manufacturing facility in the Czech Republic has ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that this facility was operated by government-owned entities. The remediation project consists primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located on-site and off-site, with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded. The government of the Czech Republic has agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries, subject to specified limitations, for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination. Based upon the information available, we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Our design center in East Greenwich, Rhode Island is located on property that has localized soil contamination. When we purchased the East Greenwich facility, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Covenant Not To Sue with the State of Rhode Island. This agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property. Based on the information available, we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">As a result of the acquisition of AMIS, we are a “primary responsible party” to an environmental remediation and cleanup at AMIS’s former corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Costs incurred by AMIS include implementation of the clean-up plan, operations and maintenance of remediation systems, and other project management costs. However, AMIS’s former parent company, a subsidiary of Nippon Mining contractually agreed to indemnify AMIS and us for any obligation relating to environmental remediation and cleanup at this location. Based on the information available, we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. We do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, and liability for currently known environmental conditions, to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects. It is possible, however, that future developments, including changes in laws and regulations, government policies, customer specification, personnel and physical property conditions, including currently undiscovered contamination, could lead to material costs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 20,000 employees worldwide, of which approximately 2,300 employees were in the United States. None of our employees in the United States are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Certain of our foreign employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements (i.e., Japan and Belgium) or similar arrangements or are represented by workers councils. For information regarding employee risk associated with our international operations, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors— Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business” elsewhere in this report.
