The total transaction value is expected to be approximately $2.4 billion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Fairchild Agreement, we, through Falcon Operations Sub, Inc., have commenced an offer (the “Offer”) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Fairchild’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Shares”), for $20.00 per share in cash, without interest (the “Offer Price”). The Offer is subject to certain conditions, including the tender of at least a majority of the then outstanding Shares. Following successful completion of the Offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Fairchild Agreement, including the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals, Falcon Operations Sub, Inc. will be merged with and into Fairchild, with Fairchild surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each outstanding Share (other than Shares held by (i) ON Semiconductor, Fairchild or their respective subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) stockholders of Fairchild who properly exercised their appraisal rights under the Delaware General Corporation Law) will be canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price. In addition, immediately prior to the Effective Time, all outstanding options to purchase Shares, restricted stock units, deferred stock units and performance units will become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (net of any applicable exercise price with respect to options).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">7</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We intend to finance the estimated $2.4 billion of cash consideration with a combination of cash on hand, proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities and new, fully-committed debt financing. On November 18, 2015, we entered into a commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”) with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (“DBSI”), Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch (“Deutsche Bank”), Bank of America, N.A. (“Bank of America”) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated (“Merrill Lynch”) pursuant to which Deutsche Bank and Bank of America have committed to provide a $2.4 billion term loan facility (the “Term Loan”) and a $300 million revolving credit facility that may be increased by an additional $200 million (the “Revolver,” together with the provision of the Term Loan and Revolver as set forth in the Commitment Letter, the “Financing”) subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Term Loan is available to (i) finance the Offer and related Merger pursuant to the Fairchild Agreement, and (ii) pay fees and expenses related to the Merger and the Financing. Under the Commitment Letter, DBSI and Merrill Lynch will act as joint lead arrangers and bookrunners. The Commitment Letter provides, among other matters, for an initial commitment period until August 18, 2016 to effect the Financing, subject to three one-month extensions for regulatory approvals. The actual documentation governing the Financing has not been finalized, and accordingly, the actual terms may differ from the description of such terms in the Commitment Letter.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The transactions contemplated by the Fairchild Agreement have been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Fairchild Agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Fairchild Agreement, as well as other customary closing conditions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A detailed description of the transactions contemplated by the Fairchild Agreement can be found in the 8-K filed by us with the SEC on November 18, 2015, the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (including the related tender offer materials, including the offer to purchase, the related letter of transmittal and certain other tender offer documents) filed by us with the SEC on December 4, 2015, the Solicitation/ Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 filed by Fairchild with the SEC with respect to the tender offer on December 4, 2015 and all subsequent amendments and supplements to those documents filed with the SEC by us and Fairchild. We currently expect the transactions contemplated by the Fairchild Agreement to close late in the second quarter of 2016. Factors, such as the possibility of an intervening offer for Fairchild or our ability to obtain the debt financing we need to consummate the Fairchild Transaction, may affect when and whether the Merger will occur.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information.

The aggregate purchase price of this transaction was approximately $8.0 million in cash consideration, plus an additional unlimited contingent consideration with a fair value of $5.0 million as of the acquisition date. We believe the acquisition of AXSEM expands the Company’s industrial and timing business and is another step forward in expanding the Company’s presence in select segments of the industrial end-market. See Note 4: “Acquisitions” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On August 15, 2014, we completed the purchase of Aptina, whereby Aptina became our wholly-owned subsidiary. The aggregate purchase price of this transaction was approximately $405.4 million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments. We believe the acquisition of Aptina expands our image sensor business and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">8</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">establishes ON Semiconductor as one of the leaders in the fast growing segment of image sensors in the automotive and industrial end-markets. See Note 4: “Acquisitions” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On April 30, 2014, we completed the purchase of Truesense, whereby Truesense became our wholly-owned subsidiary. The aggregate purchase price of this transaction was approximately $95.7 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. We believe that the acquisition of Truesense strengthens our product portfolio targeting industrial end-markets such as machine vision, surveillance and intelligent transportation systems by complementing our existing high-speed, high-resolution, power- efficient image sensing solutions with Truesense’s high-performance image sensors for low-light, low-noise. See Note 4: “Acquisitions” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On February 27, 2011, we acquired 100% of the CMOS ISBU from Cypress Semiconductor for $34.1 million in cash. The ISBU includes a portfolio of custom and standard image sensors used in multi-megapixel machine vision, linear and two dimensional bar code imaging, medical x-ray imaging, biometrics, digital photography and cinematography, and aerospace applications. The acquired products include the VITA, LUPA, STAR, and IBIS families.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On January 1, 2011, we paid SANYO Electric $142.1 million in cash and issued a $377.5 million note payable to SANYO Electric, through SCI LLC, in exchange for a 100% interest in SANYO Semiconductor and certain other semiconductor related assets held by SANYO Electric. In the second quarter of 2011, we received approximately $39.7 million in cash from SANYO Electric for working capital and pension adjustments as determined in accordance with the purchase agreement, which resulted in a net purchase price of $479.9 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The acquisition of SANYO Semiconductor provided us with a stronger market presence in Japan, with many leading Japan-based customers, some of which were previously our customers. We believe that this acquisition has provided and will continue to provide us with access to market-leading Japanese and Asian customers, while providing our System Solutions Group’s customers with access to front-end mixed-signal and analog manufacturing, and ultra high volume back-end facilities. Since acquiring SANYO Semiconductor in 2011, we have incurred material restructuring expenses to achieve cost savings in order to align the System Solutions Group’s cost structure with expected revenue levels as the System Solutions Group experienced revenue and financial performance declines which were greater than our expectations and greater than cyclical declines in our other operating segments. These revenue declines were at least partially attributable to the impact from the October 2011 Thailand flood, a softening of the Japanese consumer market and, to a lesser extent, political tensions between Japan and China.

We are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace. Generally, our electronic manufacturing service customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our standard warranty.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">See Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 18: “Segment Information” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for revenues by geographic locations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing Operations</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We operate front-end wafer site facilities in Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Japan, Malaysia, and the United States and back-end assembly and test site facilities in Canada, China, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam and the United States.

Our investment in Leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements. Our joint venture partner, Leshan Radio Company Ltd., is formerly a state-owned enterprise. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement, requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of Leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture. Each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder, provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity (which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity) in lieu of satisfying the commitment. We committed to purchase 80% of Leshan’s production capacity in 2015, 70% in 2014 and 2013 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 80% of Leshan’s expected production capacity in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we acquired an additional equity interest in Leshan, see Note 9: “Earnings Per Share and Equity” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We use third-party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities, primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods. Our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts. In some cases, longer- term commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship. These contract manufacturers, including Amkor, ASE, LFoundry S.r.l., Kingpak, TSMC and UMC, accounted for approximately 39%, 30% and 26% of our manufacturing costs in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” under the heading “Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business” included elsewhere in this report.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Raw Materials</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, gold, copper, and lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases.

From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply, increased demand in the industry or other factors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales, Marketing and Distribution</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As of December 31, 2015, our global sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 1,200 professionals, servicing customers in approximately 70 countries.

Our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our IP rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents, copyrights and other IP rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Seasonality</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Historically, our revenues have been affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related end-markets consisting of a stronger second half of the year for certain end-markets as compared to the first half of the year. We have, in the past, experienced substantial quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenues and operating results and, in the future, could continue to experience period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions or for other reasons.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Backlog</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to orders that are predominantly booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery. Generally, prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking. Backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demand from our Electronic Data Interface customers, in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13-week period following such date. Backlog is influenced by several factors, including market demand, pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times. For those shipments to distributors who are allowed sales return rights and allowances, we record revenues on a “sell-through” basis. Thus, backlog comprised of orders from these distributors will not result in revenues until these distributors sell the products ordered. During 2015, our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 80% and 85% of actual revenues during such quarter, which is consistent with backlog levels in recent prior periods. As manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases, customers tend to order products further in advance and, as a result, backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the semiconductor industry, backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs. Agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or, as a matter of industry practice, are often not enforced. Therefore, a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable. For these reasons, the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with just-in-time principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products. However, these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Competition</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The semiconductor industry, particularly the market for general-purpose semiconductor products like ours, is highly competitive. We face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies, as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. Because our</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 237pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">18</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">components are often building block semiconductors that, in some cases, can be integrated into more complex ICs, we also face competition from manufacturers of ICs, ASICs and fully-customized ICs, as well as customers who develop their own IC products. See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors - Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business” located elsewhere in this report for additional information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In comparison, several competitors noted below are larger in scale and size, have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. The following discusses the effects of competition on our four operating segments:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Application Products Group</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The principal methods of competition in the Application Products Group are with other custom semiconductor vendors based on design experience, manufacturing capability, depth and quality of IP, ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product, length of design cycle, longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables, both inside and outside of our control. These variables include, but are not limited to, the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies, product performance and quality, manufacturing yields and availability, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends. Select competitors for certain of our products and solutions include: NXP Semiconductors N.V.; Infineon Technologies AG; Intersil Corporation; Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.; Melexis N.V.; STMicroelectronics N.V.; Texas Instruments Inc.; and Silicon Labs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Image Sensor Group</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Image Sensor Group differentiates itself from the competition by leveraging deep technical knowledge and close customer relationships to drive the most compelling imaging experience for end users. The Image Sensor Group has over four decades of CCD imaging experience and was the first to commercialize CMOS active pixel sensors.

Our design expertise in analog, digital, mixed signal and imaging ICs, combined with our extensive portfolio of standard products enable the company to offer comprehensive, value added solutions to our global customers for their electronics systems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Government Regulation</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites, and the investigation and remediation of contamination.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona is located on property that is a “Superfund” site, a property listed on the National Priorities List and subject to clean-up activities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Motorola and now Freescale have been actively involved in the cleanup of on-site solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and off-site contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the State of Arizona. As part of our separation from Motorola in 1999, Motorola retained responsibility for this contamination, and Motorola and Freescale (which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of NXP Semiconductors N.V. on December 7, 2015) have agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our former manufacturing location in Aizu, Japan is located on property where soil and ground water contamination has been detected. We believe that the contamination originally occurred during a time when the facility was operated by a prior owner. We have been working with local authorities to implement remediation actions and expect all remaining remediation costs to be covered by insurance. Based on information available, any net costs to us in connection with this matter are not expected to be material.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our manufacturing facility in the Czech Republic has ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that this facility was operated by government-owned entities. The remediation projects consist primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located on-site and off-site, with</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 237pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">20</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded. The government of the Czech Republic has agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries, subject to specified limitations, for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination. Based upon the information available, we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our design center in East Greenwich, Rhode Island is located on property that has localized soil contamination. When we purchased the East Greenwich facility, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Covenant Not To Sue with the State of Rhode Island. This agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property. Based on the information available, we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a result of the acquisition of AMIS in 2008, we are a “primary responsible party” to an environmental remediation and cleanup at AMIS’s former corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Costs incurred by AMIS include implementation of the clean-up plan, operations and maintenance of remediation systems and other project management costs. However, AMIS’s former parent company, a subsidiary of Nippon Mining, contractually agreed to indemnify AMIS and us for any obligations relating to environmental remediation and clean-up at this location. Based on the information available, we do not believe that any future costs to us in connection with this matter will be material.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We were notified by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) that we have been identified as a “potentially responsible party” (“PRP”) in the Chemetco Superfund matter. Chemetco is a defunct reclamation services supplier who operated in Illinois at what is now a Superfund site. We used Chemetco for reclamation services. The EPA is pursuing Chemetco customers for contribution to the site cleanup activities. We have joined a PRP group which is cooperating with the EPA in the evaluation and funding of the cleanup. Based on the information available, any costs to us in connection with this matter have not been, and are not expected to be, material.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. We do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, and liability for currently known environmental conditions, to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects. It is possible, however, that future developments, including changes in laws and regulations, government policies, customer specification, personnel and physical property conditions, including currently undiscovered contamination, could lead to material costs. See Note 12: “Commitments and Contingencies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for information on certain environmental matters.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Employees</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 24,500 employees worldwide, of which approximately 3,200 employees were in the United States.
