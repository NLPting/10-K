(“Cirrus Logic,” “We,” “Us,” “Our,” or the “Company”) develops high-precision, analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (“ICs”) for a broad range of consumer and industrial markets. Building on our diverse analog mixed-signal patent portfolio, Cirrus Logic delivers highly optimized products for consumer and professional audio, automotive entertainment, and targeted industrial applications including energy control, energy measurement, light emitting diode (“LED”) lighting and energy exploration.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We were incorporated in California in 1984, became a public company in 1989 and were reincorporated in the State of Delaware in February 1999. Our primary facility housing engineering, sales and marketing, and administrative functions is located in Austin, Texas. We also serve customers from sales offices in the United States, Europe and Asia, including the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

Analog semiconductors process a continuous range of signals that can represent functions such as temperature, speed, pressure and sound. Digital semiconductors process information represented by discrete values, for example, 0s and 1s. Mixed-signal semiconductors combine analog and digital circuits in a single product. The design of the analog component of a mixed-signal IC is particularly complex and difficult, and requires experienced engineers to optimize speed, power and resolution within standard manufacturing processes.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The convergence and sophistication of our customers’ products, such as portable audio applications, home entertainment and automotive audio devices, is made possible in part by advances in semiconductor technology. Semiconductor companies are attempting to differentiate their products by offering new features and functionality to customers, while at the same time shrinking product sizes, reducing power consumption, and lowering overall system costs.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Due to the extremely high costs involved in developing and operating a wafer fabrication facility, many semiconductor companies, including Cirrus, rely on third party foundries to manufacture their ICs. We believe that our fabless manufacturing model significantly reduces our capital requirements and allows us to focus our resources on the design, development, and marketing of our ICs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Segments</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We determine our operating segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidelines. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) has been identified as the chief operating decision maker as defined by these guidelines.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The Company operates and tracks its results in one reportable segment, but reports revenue performance in two product lines, which currently are audio and energy. Our CEO receives and uses enterprise-wide financial information to assess financial performance and allocate resources, rather than detailed information at a product line level. Additionally, our product lines have similar characteristics and customers. They share operations</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 229pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Page 3 of 69</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">support functions such as sales, public relations, supply chain management, various research and development and engineering support, in addition to the general and administrative functions of human resources, legal, finance and information technology. Therefore, there is no discrete financial information maintained for these product lines. For fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, audio product sales were $754.8 million, $350.7 million, and $264.8 million, respectively. For fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, energy product sales were $55.0 million, $76.1 million, and $104.7 million, respectively.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">See Note 18 - Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for further details including sales and property, plant and equipment, net, by geographic locations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Company Strategy</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We target growing markets where we can showcase our expertise in analog and digital signal processing to solve challenging problems. Our approach has been to develop new custom and catalog components that embody our latest innovations, which we then use to engage with the leading customers in a particular market or application. We then focus on building a strong engineering relationship with the design teams at these customers and work to develop highly differentiated products that address their specific needs using our own intellectual property (“IP”), sometimes in combination with theirs. When we have been successful with this approach, one initial design win has expanded into many additional products. This strategy gives us the opportunity to increase our content per box with a customer over time through the addition of new features and the integration of other system components into our products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Markets and Products</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following provides a detailed discussion regarding our audio and energy product lines:</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Audio Products<span class="p">: High-precision analog and mixed-signal components, as well as audio digital signal processor (“DSP”) products for consumer, professional and automotive entertainment markets.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Energy Products<span class="p">: High-precision analog and mixed-signal components for energy-related applications, such as LED lighting, energy measurement, energy exploration and energy control systems.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 228pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">AUDIO PRODUCTS</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We are a recognized leader in analog and mixed-signal audio converter and audio DSP products that enable today’s new consumer, professional and automotive entertainment applications. Our broad portfolio of approximately 250 active proprietary audio products includes analog-to-digital converters (“ADCs”), digital-to-analog converters (“DACs”), “codecs”—chips that integrate ADCs and DACs into a single IC, digital interface ICs, volume controls, adaptive noise cancelling circuits (“ANC”) and amplifiers, as well as audio DSPs.

Applications for products within automotive markets include amplifiers, satellite radio systems, telematics and multi-speaker car-audio systems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 229pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">ENERGY PRODUCTS</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We provide high-precision analog and mixed-signal ICs for targeted energy control, energy measurement, LED lighting and energy exploration applications. We have approximately 450 active proprietary energy products which include LED driver ICs, power factor correction ICs, ADC, and DACs. Our products are used in a wide array of high-precision, energy-related applications including LED retrofit lamps, digital utility meters, power supplies and energy exploration.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 229pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Page 4 of 69</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Customers, Marketing, and Sales</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We offer approximately 700 products worldwide through both direct and indirect sales channels. Our major customers are among the world’s leading electronics manufacturers. We target both large existing and emerging growth consumer electronic and energy markets that derive value from our expertise in advanced analog and mixed-signal design processing, systems-level integrated circuit engineering and embedded software development. We derive our sales both domestically and from a variety of locations across the world, including the People’s Republic of China, the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. Our domestic sales force includes a network of regional direct sales offices located in California, Nevada, and Texas. International sales offices and staff are located in Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen in the People’s Republic of China, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and the United Kingdom. We supplement our direct sales force with external sales representatives and distributors. Our technical support staff is located in Texas. Our worldwide sales force provides geographically specific support to our customers and specialized selling of product lines with unique customer bases. See Note 18—Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for further detail and for additional disclosure regarding sales and property, plant and equipment, net, by geographic locations.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Since the components we produce are largely proprietary and generally not available from second sources, we generally consider our end customer to be the entity specifying the use of our component in their design. These end customers may then purchase our products directly from us, from an external sales representative or distributor, or through a third party manufacturer contracted to produce their designs. For fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, our ten largest end customers represented approximately 89 percent, 74 percent, and 62 percent, of our sales, respectively. For fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, we had one end customer, Apple Inc., who purchased through multiple contract manufacturers and represented approximately 82 percent, 62 percent, and 47 percent, of the Company’s total sales, respectively. For fiscal years 2012, and 2011, we had one distributor, Avnet Inc., who represented 15 percent, and 24 percent, of our sales, respectively. No other customer or distributor represented more than 10 percent of net sales in fiscal years 2013, 2012, or 2011.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">As a fabless semiconductor company, we contract with third parties for wafer fabrication and our assembly and test operations. We use multiple wafer foundries, assembly sources and test houses in the production of our inventory. The Company owned a 54,000 square foot facility in Tucson, Arizona, which served as the assembly and test facility for the Apex Precision Power (“Apex”) product line prior to the Company selling the assets related to this entity in the fall of fiscal year 2013. Our outsourced manufacturing strategy allows us to concentrate on our design strengths, minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures while giving us access to advanced manufacturing facilities, and provide the flexibility to source multiple leading-edge technologies through strategic relationships. After wafer fabrication by the foundry, third-party assembly vendors package the wafer die. The finished products are then tested before shipment to our customers. While we do have some redundancy of fabrication processes by using multiple outside foundries, any interruption of supply by one or more of these foundries could materially impact us. As a result, we maintain some amount of business interruption insurance to help reduce the risk of wafer supply interruption, but we are not fully insured against such risk.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our supply chain management organization is responsible for the management of all aspects of the manufacturing, assembly, and testing of our products, including process and package development, test program development, and production testing of products in accordance with our ISO-certified quality management system.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Although our products are made from basic materials (principally silicon, metals and plastics), all of which are available from a number of suppliers, capacity at wafer foundries sometimes becomes constrained. The limited availability of certain materials may impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand needs or impact the price we are charged. The prices of certain other basic materials, such as metals, gases and chemicals used in the production of circuits can increase as demand grows for these basic commodities. In most cases, we do not procure these materials ourselves; nevertheless, we are reliant on such materials for producing our products because our outside foundry and package and test subcontractors must procure them. To help mitigate risks associated with constrained capacity, we use multiple foundries, assembly and test sources.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 229pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Page 5 of 69</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patents, Licenses and Trademarks</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property, products, and technology. As of March 30, 2013, we held approximately 988 granted U.S. patents, 136 U.S. pending patent applications and various corresponding international patents and applications. Our U.S. patents expire in calendar years 2013 through 2031. While our patents are an important element of our success, our business as a whole is not dependent on any one patent or group of patents. We do not anticipate any material effect on our business due to any patents expiring in 2013, and we continue to obtain new patents through our ongoing research and development.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We have maintained U.S. federal trademark registrations for CIRRUS LOGIC, CIRRUS, Cirrus Logic logo designs, and CRYSTAL. These U.S. registrations may be renewed as long as the marks continue to be used in interstate commerce. We have also filed or obtained foreign registration for these marks in other countries or jurisdictions where we conduct, or anticipate conducting, international business.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">To complement our own research and development efforts, we have also licensed and expect to continue to license, a variety of intellectual property and technologies important to our business from third parties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</h1><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We concentrate our research and development efforts on the design and development of new products for each of our principal markets. We also fund certain advanced-process technology development, as well as other emerging product opportunities. Expenditures for research and development in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011 were $114.1 million, $85.7 million, and $63.9 million, respectively. Our future success is highly dependent upon our ability to develop complex new products, transfer new products to volume production, introduce them into the marketplace in a timely fashion, and have them selected for design into products of systems manufacturers. Our future success may also depend on assisting our customers with integration of our components into their new products, including providing support from the concept stage through design, launch and production ramp.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Markets for our products are highly competitive and we expect that competition will continue to increase. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit key engineering talent, execute on new product developments, persuade customers to design-in these new products into their applications, and provide lower-cost versions of existing products. We compete with other semiconductor suppliers that offer standard semiconductors, application-specific standard product and fully customized ICs, including embedded software, chip and board-level products.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">While no single company competes with us in all of our product lines, we face significant competition in all markets where our products are available. We expect to face additional competition from new entrants in our markets, which may include both large domestic and international IC manufacturers and smaller, emerging companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">The principal competitive factors in our markets include: time to market; quality of hardware/software design and end-market systems expertise; price; product benefits that are characterized by performance, features, quality and compatibility with standards; access to advanced process and packaging technologies at competitive prices; and sales and technical support, which includes assisting our customers with integration of our components into their new products and providing support from the concept stage through design, launch and production ramp.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Product life cycles may vary greatly by product category. For example, many consumer electronic devices have shorter design-in cycles; therefore, our competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to achieve design wins in next-generation systems. Conversely, this also provides us frequent opportunities to displace competitors in products that have previously not utilized our design. The industrial and automotive markets typically have longer life cycles, which provide continued revenue streams over longer periods of time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 229pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Page 6 of 69</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Sales are made primarily pursuant to short-term purchase orders for delivery of products. The quantity actually ordered by the customer, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently revised, without significant penalty, to reflect changes in the customer’s needs. The majority of our backlog is typically requested for delivery within six months. In markets where the end system life cycles are relatively short, customers typically request delivery in six to ten weeks. We believe a backlog analysis at any given time gives little indication of our future business except on a short-term basis, principally within the next 60 days.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">We utilize backlog as an indicator to assist us in production planning. However, backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand, pricing, and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times. Quantities actually purchased by customers, as well as prices, are subject to variations between booking and delivery because of changes in customer needs or industry conditions. As a result, we believe that our backlog at any given time is an incomplete indicator of future sales.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">As of March 30, 2013, we had 652 full-time employees, a decrease of 15 employees, or 2 percent, over the end of fiscal year 2012. The decrease was primarily due to the restructuring during the 2013 fiscal year. Of our full-time employees, 62 percent were engaged in research and product development activities, 27 percent in</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sales, marketing, general and administrative activities, and 11 percent in manufacturing-related activities. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical, marketing, engineering, and administrative personnel.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">good.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Forward—Looking Statements</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">This Annual Report on Form 10-K and certain information incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities the Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
