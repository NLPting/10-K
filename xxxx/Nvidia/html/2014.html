In light of industry practice and experience, we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seasonality</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our GPU and Tegra processor products serve many markets from consumer PC gaming to enterprise workstations to government and service provider cloud datacenters; however, a majority of our revenue is consumer focused. Our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. However, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">8</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_006.png"/></span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products. Instead, we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our product-line operating segments whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability and testing. In addition, this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. Our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing and customer support.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., JSI Logistics Ltd., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd. and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to perform assembly, testing and packaging of most of our products. We purchase substrates from IbidenCo., Ltd., Nanya Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to CEMs, distributors, motherboard and AIB customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders or OEMs as motherboard and add-in board solutions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Inventory and Working Capital</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a product-by-product basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand. The quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers&#39; requirements and in manufacturing availability. We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. A substantial amount of our inventories are maintained as semi-finished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 25.3% to $4.67 billion at the end offiscal year 2014 compared with the end of fiscal year 2013, primarily due to our issuance of $1.5 billion in Convertible Senior Notes in December 2013. We believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition, capital purchases and our intended capital return to shareholders needs for at least the next twelve months.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology including 3D graphics, HD video, audio, ultra-low power consumption and SOC architectures is essential to our future success. Our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of GPUs and Tegra Processors, including GPUs for high-performance computing, and Tegra SOCs for SHIELD and other mobile products using independent design teams. Our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering, hardware engineering, very large scale integration design engineering, process engineering, architecture and algorithms. These groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">A critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer-aided design industry. We invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders, often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products. We believe that forming these relationships and utilizing next-generation development tools to design, simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3D graphics market and develop products that utilize leading-edge technology on a rapid basis. We believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of PC OEMs and other manufacturers. We believe in leveraging our significant R&amp;D depth and scale to create differentiated products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">As of January 26, 2014, we had 6,384 full-time employees engaged in research and development. During fiscal years2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred research and development expense of $1,335.8 million, $1,147.3 million and $1,002.6 million, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_007.png"/></span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 124%;text-align: justify;">The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard Application Programming Interfaces, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share<span class="s2">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs and mobile SOC products. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our current competitors include:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l5"><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">suppliers of SOC products that support tablets, smartphones, and PCs as well as products that are embedded into smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as AMD, ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, Broadcom Corporation, Freescale Semiconductor Inc., HiSilicon Technologies Co., Ltd., Imagination Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Technology Corp., Samsung Electronics Co.

Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Partners</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If we are unable to compete in the markets for our products, our financial results will be adversely impacted<span class="h1">.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The market for our products is extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings, industry standards continue to evolve and others realize the market potential of mobile and consumer products and services.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share. Furthermore, competitors with greater financial resources may be able to offer lower prices than us, or they may offer additional products, services or other incentives that we may not be able to match. In addition, many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and greater sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. In order to effectively compete we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. In order to remain competitive and meet the demands of the markets we serve, we expect to devote a substantial portion of our resources to research and development. Our ability to compete will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">continue to keep pace with technological developments;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">develop and introduce new products, services, technologies and enhancements on a timely basis;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials; and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">succeed in significant foreign markets, such as China and India.</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">If we are unable to compete in our current or new markets, demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer. If and to the extent we offer products in new markets, we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete. We expect substantial competition from both Intel and AMD&#39;s, strategy of selling platform solutions, including integrating a CPU and a GPU on the same chip or same package, as evidenced by Intel&#39;s CPUs with integrated graphics and AMD&#39;s APU product. As AMD and Intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated CPUs, we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted. Despite the use of these integrated CPUs, personal computer, or PC, builders and consumers have continued to embrace discrete GPUs to provide higher performance. If integrated CPUs offer a more compelling value proposition in the future, PC builders and consumers may move away from the use of discrete GPUs, which could adversely affect our business and cause our financial results to decline.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We are implementing a business strategy to license our GPU cores and visual computing patent portfolio to device manufacturers. Although we have engaged in licensing in the past, we are now engaging a broader market with new and existing competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot be assured of the extent of the demand for licenses to our GPU cores or other elements of our visual computing patent portfolio, or that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">13</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2014/Image_011.png"/></span></p></body></html>
