This requires simulating the physical behavior of light and materials, or physically-based rendering, an emerging trend in professional design. Our Iray and DesignWorks software delivers this to designers. They enable an architect designing a building with a computer-aided design package to interact with the model in real time, view the model in greater detail, and generate photorealistic renderings for the client. And they enable an automotive designer to create a highly realistic 3D image of a car, which can be viewed from all angles, reducing reliance on creating costly, time-consuming full-scale clay models.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Just as virtual reality is becoming more important in gaming, there is a growing number of enterprise applications - within medicine, architecture, product design and retailing - that we are helping to enable for virtual experiences.

The proportion of supercomputers utilizing accelerators has grown sharply over the past five years, now accounting for one-fifth of the systems on the Top 500 list and one-third of the list’s total floating-point operations per second. Tesla GPU accelerators power the fastest supercomputers in the United States, Japan and Europe. They will also drive the U.S. Energy Department’s next generation of supercomputers at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Tesla has had a significant impact on scientific discovery, including improving heart surgery, HIV research and mapping human genome folds. Tesla GPUs and our cuDNN software have been broadly adopted for deep learning, a new computing method for enabling artificial intelligence. Deep learning enables computers to learn for themselves and perform tasks, like recognizing images, text and speech - in some cases better than humans. Leading web-services companies are using GPUs to improve consumer cloud services. The use of deep learning is growing rapidly in many industries, automating such tasks as reading medical imaging, surveying coral on the sea bottom and robotically thinning lettuce harvests to maximize crop yields.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We also serve the Datacenter market with GRID for virtualized graphics. GRID makes it possible to run graphics-intensive applications remotely on a server in the datacenter, instead of locally on a PC or workstation. Applications include accelerating virtual desktop infrastructures and delivering graphics-intensive applications from the cloud.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Automotive</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The automotive technology market has grown tremendously as the car itself is becoming a powerful computer. Cars will feature a multitude of devices, driven by sophisticated software algorithms. These devices will be designed to ensure our safety and the safety of those around us, enhance our comfort and enjoyment, and search and navigate. They will use the tools of deep learning to sense their environment, ultimately driving themselves.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Our products are in more than 10 million cars on the road today, powering infotainment, navigation and virtual cockpit systems from a broad range of automakers.

Instead, we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our product-line operating segments whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability and testing. In addition, this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the majority of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing and customer support.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., BYD Auto Co. Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., JSI Logistics Ltd., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd. and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to perform assembly, testing and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We purchase substrates from IbidenCo., Ltd., Nanya Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors, motherboard and AIB customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders or OEMs as motherboard and add-in board solutions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Working Capital</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a product-by-product basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand. The quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers&#39; requirements and in manufacturing availability. We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. A substantial amount of our inventories are maintained as semi-finished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 9% to $5.04 billion at the end of fiscal year 2016 compared with the end of fiscal year 2015. We believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition, capital expenditure and intended capital return to shareholders needs for at least the next twelve months.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">8</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2016/Image_005.png"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology is essential to our future success. Our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of GPUs and Tegra Processors, including GPUs for high- performance computing, and Tegra SOCs for SHIELD and other mobile products using independent design teams. Our research and development efforts include software engineering, hardware engineering, very large scale integration design engineering, process engineering, architecture and algorithms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">A critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with industry leaders. We invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders, often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products. We believe that forming these relationships and utilizing next- generation development tools to design, simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of visual computing and develop products that utilize leading-edge technology on a rapid basis. We believe in leveraging our significant research and development depth and scale to create differentiated products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">As of January 31, 2016, we had 6,566 full-time employees engaged in research and development. During fiscal years2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred research and development expense of $1.33 billion, $1.36 billion and $1.34 billion, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard Application Programming Interfaces, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs and mobile SOC products. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our current competitors include:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l3"><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2016/Image_006.png"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patents and Proprietary Rights</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from April 2016 to December 2034. We have numerous patents issued, allowed and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely.

RISK FACTORS</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">In evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Partners</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, our revenue and financial results will be adversely impacte<span class="s1">.</span>d</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">NVIDIA-branded products and services are visual computing platforms that address four large markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive. Our products, services and technologies are designed to meet the evolving needs of these markets; however, these markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve and new competitors enter these markets. Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify and develop new products, services and technologies, and enhancements to our existing products, services and technologies, in a timely and cost-effective manner and to achieve consumer and market acceptance of them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, including in significant international markets such as China, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer. In addition, if we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, our business will be harmed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or different features than ours. In addition, many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, quickly transition their semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If we fail to successfully execute our transitions to new business models and markets, our results of operations could suffer.</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">In connection with our diversification into new business models, we have transformed into a specialized platform company, targeting markets where visual computing is essential and valued. Our business strategy is dependent on creating products and services that anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. We cannot assure you that our new strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers and partners. We also devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where our operating history is less extensive, such as the automotive market. These new offerings and markets may require a considerable investment of technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing resources. If demand for products and services from these growth markets is below our expectations or if we are not able to improve the cost or operational efficiencies of these new business models, we may not realize benefits from our strategy. Alternatively, we may not be able to effectively implement our strategy, or adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities or meet competitive challenges. If we are unable to successfully establish new offerings in light of the competitive environment, our results of operations could suffer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If we do not replace our Intel licensing revenues, our financial results may be adversely affected.</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">In January 2011, we entered into a patent cross licensing agreement under which Intel agreed to pay us an aggregate of $1.50 billion over six years. The final $200 million payment under this agreement was received in January 2016. We will be recognizing revenue under this agreement through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. If we do not enter into new licensing agreements or if the Intel agreement is not offset by other growth in income our financial results may be adversely affected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">12</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2016/Image_009.png"/></span></p></body></html>
