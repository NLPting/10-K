In a world increasingly filled with visual displays, our graphics technologies let our customers interact with the world of digital ideas, information and entertainment with an efficiency that no other communication medium can provide. Visualization transcends cultural and language boundaries and enhances the quality of life whether the setting is work or pleasure and the task is mission critical or for entertainment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We have long been known to millions around the world for creating the graphics chips used in PCs that bring video games to life. With our invention of the GPU, we introduced the world to the power of programmable shading, which defines modern computer graphics. Today, we reach well beyond PC graphics and games. Our energy-efficient processors are at the heart of products ranging from mobile devices to supercomputers. PC gamers choose our GPUs by name to enjoy immersive fantasy worlds. Our Tegra processors power smartphones, tablets and automobile infotainment systems. Professional designers use our GPUs to create visual effects in movies and design everything from audio headsets to commercial aircraft. And supercomputers take advantage of the massively parallel processing capabilities of our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulations of viruses at the molecular level, to modern weather forecasting and global oil exploration.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">NVIDIA&#39;s research and development in visual computing has yielded more than 5,000 patents granted or pending worldwide, and including ones covering inventions essential to modern computing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our businesses are based on two important technologies: the GPU and the Tegra processor. GPUs, each with billions of transistors, are the engine of visual computing and among the world&#39;s most complex processors. We have GPU product brands designed for specific users and applications: GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla for researchers; and GRID VGX for cloud-based server graphics modules. We recently announced the NVIDIA GRID visual computing appliance, a fully integrated system with GRID VGX graphics modules that run NVIDIA&#39;s proprietary system software. GRID is a first-of-its-kind device, designed to serve graphics-intensive applications from the cloud simultaneously to a large number of concurrent users.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The Tegra processor is a system-on-a-chip, or SOC, integrating an entire computer on a single chip. Tegra processors incorporate multi-core GPUs and CPUs together with audio, video and input/output capabilities. They can also be integrated with baseband processors for phone and data communication.

The combination of Tegra and our significant computing software assets enables us to address the many new markets for connected smart devices. For example, 60 million cars are sold each year, and all, we believe, will eventually include multiple Tegra-like computers that augment our driving experience. They will ensure our safety and the safety of those around us, search and navigate to destinations through heads-up displays, and enhance our comfort and enjoyment. Cars will be connected to our mobile devices. They may someday drive themselves out of parking garages to meet their owners, with the seat and temperature already set to their liking.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Increasingly, devices will be smarter and connected. There will be smart TVs that respond to voice and gesture commands, smart monitors powered by Android making a PC optional, watches and jewelry that recognize voice commands and make calls. Our mobile strategy is to put Tegra into every device where visual computing is valued.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cloud</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The computer industry has gone through several major industry shifts - from client-servers, to PCs, to mobile devices connected to the Internet. But none appear to be as sweeping as cloud computing, in which computing devices are connected to the cloud and applications are served as a service.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">By extending visual computing into the cloud, NVIDIA is expanding the application of the GPU beyond the PC into the server and datacenter. Virtualizing the GPU enables it to be shared by many concurrent users.

Developers are able to accelerate algorithms in areas ranging from molecular dynamics to image processing, X-ray image reconstruction and derivatives modeling for financial risk analysis. We believe the work we are doing around GPU computing is an important step to the future of how computing will be done.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Extend our Visual Computing Leadership into Mobile and Cloud Computing Platforms. <span class="p">Mobile, cloud and SaaS are driving changes in the computer industry. Although a great challenge to make possible due to the significant computational intensity of graphics, we believe visual computing will be a key component in this new computing paradigm. As with books and music, we want to enable interactive graphics applications like games, movie and photo editors, and design software to be accessed from any computer and from anywhere.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Leverage our Processors and Visual Computing Expertise to Create Differentiated Devices. <span class="p">We recently announced Project SHIELD, an NVIDIA developed and branded Android device designed for gaming and featuring our latest processor Tegra 4. We believe Project SHIELD will attract modern gamers who want to play on open platforms and untethered to the living room. We believe Project SHIELD will also enhance the strategic position of Tegra. We believe Project SHIELD will attract more games to TegraZone, which will in turn make every Tegra-powered device more enjoyable. Just as Project SHIELD is a device built around Tegra, we leveraged our GPU to create a first-of-its-kind visual computing appliance called GRID. Leveraging our GPU and visual computing expertise, the NVIDIA GRID is a visual computing appliance designed to serve graphics-intensive applications to many users simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Use Our Intellectual Property and Resources to Enter into License and Development Contracts.<span class="p">We believe our technology leadership in graphics and mobile computing offers the opportunity to license our technology to strategic customers that desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products. We expect to enter into license and development arrangements, some of which may involve significant customization of our intellectual property components and further enhance the reach of our graphics and mobile technology.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2013/Image_006.png"/></span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales and Marketing</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to our objective to become the leading supplier of high-performance and efficient GPUs and mobile system-on- chip products. Our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industry&#39;s respective OEMs, original design manufacturers, or ODMs, system builders, motherboard manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs, and industry trendsetters, collectively referred to as our Channel, to define product features, performance, price and timing of new products. Members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process. We also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist our Channel in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving our Channel&#39;s time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within our Channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">In the markets we serve that purchase our GPUs, the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading OEMs and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key ODMs, motherboard manufacturers and AIBs. These design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by AIB and motherboard manufacturers. Our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, ODMs, motherboard manufacturers, AIBs and distributors, each of which have relationships with a broad range of major OEMs and/or strong brand name recognition in the retail channel. Currently, we sell a significant portion of our processors directly to distributors, CEMs, ODMs, motherboard manufacturers and AIBs, which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading OEMs, retail outlets and a large number of system builders. In the Tegra Processor segment that we serve, the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading mobile OEMs and supporting the product design into high-volume production.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">As a result of our Channel strategy, a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue. However, their end customers consist of a large number of OEMs and system builders throughout the world. Sales to our largest customer accounted for 13% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2013.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">To encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products, as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers&#39; requirements and in manufacturing availability. The semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. In light of industry practice and experience, we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seasonality</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market. Historically, we have seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year than in the first half of our fiscal year, primarily due to back-to-school and holiday demand. However, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products. Instead, we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our product-line operating segments whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability and testing. In addition, this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. Our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing and customer support.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">10</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2013/Image_007.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., JSI Logistics Ltd., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. and STATS ChipPAC Incorporated to perform assembly, testing and packaging of most of our products. We purchase substrates from Nanya Technology Corporation, IbidenCo., Ltd. and Unimicron Technology Corporation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to CEMs, distributors, motherboard and AIB customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders or OEMs as motherboard and add-in board solutions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Inventory and Working Capital</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a product-by-product basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand. The quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers&#39; requirements and in manufacturing availability. We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 19.1% at the end of fiscal year 2013 compared with the end of fiscal year 2012. We believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology including 3D graphics, HD video, audio, ultra-low power consumption and SOC architectures is essential to our future success. Our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of GPUs and Tegra Processors, including GPUs for high-performance computing, and Tegra SOCs for Project SHIELD and other mobile products using independent design teams. Our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering, hardware engineering, very large scale integration design engineering, process engineering, architecture and algorithms. These groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">A critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer-aided design industry. We invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders, often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products. We believe that forming these relationships and utilizing next-generation development tools to design, simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3D graphics market and develop products that utilize leading-edge technology on a rapid basis. We believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of PC OEMs and other manufacturers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">As of January 27, 2013, we had 5,783 full-time employees engaged in research and development. During fiscal years2013, 2012 and 2011, we incurred research and development expense of $1,147.3 million, $1,002.6 million and $848.8 million, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 124%;text-align: justify;">The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard Application Programming Interfaces, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share<span class="s2">.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">11</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2013/Image_008.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs and mobile SOC products. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our current competitors include:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l7"><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">suppliers of GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">suppliers of SOC products that support tablets, smartphones, and PCs as well as products that are embedded into smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and cars, such as AMD, Apple Inc., ARM Holdings plc, Broadcom Corporation, Fujitsu Limited, HiSilicon Technologies Co., Ltd., Imagination Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, NEC Corporation, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Technology Corp., Samsung Electronics Co.

We expect substantial competition from both Intel&#39;s and AMD&#39;s strategy of selling platform solutions, including integrating a CPU and a GPU on the same chip or same package, as evidenced by AMD&#39;s APU product and Intel&#39;s CPUs with integrated graphics. As AMD and Intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated CPUs, we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patents and Proprietary Rights</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from August 2013 to February 2032. We have numerous patents issued, allowed and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the location in which our products are manufactured;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors&#39; operations in particular countries and regions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved. In addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business. We have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons, and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements. These licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties, the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could suffer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">As of January 27, 2013, we had7,974 employees, 5,783 of whom were engaged in research and development and2,191 of whom were engaged in sales, marketing, operations and administrative positions.

RISK FACTORS</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">In evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Additionally, any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Partners</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If we are unable to compete in the markets for our products, our financial results will be adversely impacted<span class="h1">.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The market for our products is extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings, industry standards continue to evolve and others realize the market potential of mobile and consumer products and services.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share. Furthermore, competitors with greater financial resources may be able to offer lower prices than us, or they may offer additional products, services or other incentives that we may not be able to match. In addition, many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and greater sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. In order to effectively compete we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. In order to remain competitive, we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development.Our ability to compete will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">continue to keep pace with technological developments;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">develop and introduce new products, services, technologies and enhancements on a timely basis;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials; and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">succeed in significant foreign markets, such as China and India.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">14</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2013/Image_011.png"/></span></p></body></html>
