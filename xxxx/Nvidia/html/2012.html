With the invention of the graphics processing unit, or GPU, we introduced the world to the power of computer graphics. Today, we reach well beyond PC graphics. Our energy-efficient processors power a broad range of products, from smart phones to supercomputers. Our mobile processors are used in cell phones, tablets and auto infotainment systems. PC gamers rely on our GPUs to enjoy visually immersive worlds. Designers use GPUs to create visual effects in movies and create everything from golf clubs to jumbo jets. Researchers utilize GPUs to push the frontiers of science with high-performance computing. NVIDIA has nearly 5,000 patents granted and pending worldwide.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">NVIDIA solutions are based on two important technologies: the GPU and the mobile processor. Both are highly complex chips, designed by NVIDIA engineers, and manufactured for us by a third party chip foundry. GPUs are the engines of visual computing, the science and art of using computers to understand, create and enhance images. One of the most complex processors ever created, the most advanced GPUs contain billions of transistors. We have three GPU product brands: GeForce, which creates realistic visual experiences for gamers; Quadro, the standard in visual computing for designers and digital artists; and Tesla, which accelerates applications for scientists and researchers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Mobile processors incorporate central processing unit, or CPU, and GPU technologies to deliver an entire computer system on a single chip, or system-on-chip. Modern mobile processors possess significant computing capabilities yet consume one hundred times less energy than a typical PC. Tegra is our mobile processor and is built for applications ranging from smartphones, tablets and notebook PCs to televisions and cars. We believe energy-efficient mobile computing will transform how computers are used in our lives. Tegra is a major new growth business for us.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We were incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Our headquarter facilities are in Santa Clara, California.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">4</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="700" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012/Image_001.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reporting Segments</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have three primary financial reporting segments - GPU Business; Professional Solutions Business, or PSB; and Consumer Products Business, or CPB.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reporting Segments<span class="h1"> </span>Primary Revenue Sources</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 137pt;text-indent: -102pt;line-height: 132%;text-align: left;">GPU <span class="p">ž GeForce discrete graphics and chipset products and notebook PCs ž Licensing fees from Intel Corporation</span></h1><p style="padding-left: 137pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ž Memory products</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PSB <span class="p">ž Quadro professional workstation products</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 137pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ž Tesla high-performance computing products</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CPB <span class="p">ž Tegra mobile products</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 137pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 132%;text-align: justify;">ž Icera baseband processors and RF transceivers for mobile connectivity ž Royalty license fees and other revenue related to video game consoles ž GPU and Tegra products in embedded products and automobiles</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GPU Business</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our GPU business revenue includes primarily sales of our GeForce discrete and chipset products that support desktop and notebook PCs plus license fees from Intel and sales of memory products. GeForce GPUs enhance the gaming experience on consumer notebook and desktop PCs by improving the quality of game graphics and the physical realism of the game environment. They also accelerate video editing and high definition, or HD, content creation by consumers and improve the viewing experience. GeForce GPUs power PCs made by or distributed by most PC original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, in the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We ceased development of future chipset products based on the technology of the media and communications processor, or MCP, in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and expect MCP chipset revenue in fiscal 2013 to be immaterial. Our MCP chipsets primarily comprised of our ION motherboard GPUs, a product reaching the end of its life cycle.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Professional Solutions Business</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our PSB consists of our Quadro professional workstation products and our Tesla high-performance computing products. Our Quadro products are designed to deliver the highest possible level of graphics performance and application compatibility for professionals. Tesla applies the significant processing power of our GPUs to general-purpose computing problems, greatly increasing performance and power efficiency over CPU-only solutions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Quadro products improve performance and add functionality, such as photorealistic rendering, to computer-aided design workstations, and are used in professional video editing applications and for generating special effects in movies. They are recognized by many as the standard for professional graphics solutions needed to solve many of the world&#39;s most complex visual computing challenges in the manufacturing, entertainment, medical, science and aerospace industries. Quadro products are fully certified by several software developers for professional workstation applications.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our growth strategy for Quadro is twofold: increase our focus on emerging economies; and continue to make Quadro more valuable through innovations such as our Maximus technology, which allows professionals to process compute-intensive tasks and visually intensive graphics simultaneously.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We believe industrial design is increasing in emerging economies, as manufacturers in, for example, Brazil, Russia, India and China, attempt to move up the value chain from contract manufacture to full product design. Movie-making in these regions is becoming more sophisticated and is expected to make more use of Quadro, just as Hollywood does today. All five nominated films for the special effects Oscar in 2011 used Quadro, while Bollywood&#39;s first action blockbuster, RaOne, also depended on Quadro for computer-generated special effects.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">5</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012/Image_002.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">In fiscal year 2012, we launched Project Maximus, which uses the compute power of Tesla with the visualization power of Quadro to merge the design and simulation stages into one workstation. Traditionally, the design and simulation stages of new product development have been separate, requiring the designer to hand over to a simulation expert and wait for the results before revising their design. Combining the processes greatly reduces the time for each iteration. “Simulation”, in this context, can mean verifying a plastic component is capable of manufacture by modeling the injection of molten plastic into a mold, determining a product is strong enough through a stress simulation, or generating a photorealistic image of a consumer product by simulating the path of light through and across it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Tesla has had particular success in supercomputing centers and in oil exploration; other applications include accelerating drug discovery, weather simulations and derivative price modeling. Our growth strategy for Tesla is to focus on these and some other key markets, and to continue building an ecosystem of applications, development tools and developers who can develop for a massively parallel architecture like Tesla.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consumer Products Business</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our CPB includes our Tegra system-on-chip products for smartphones, tablets, automotive infotainment systems, and other similar devices, and Icera baseband processors. The significant majority of Tegra revenues are generated by sales in smart phones and tablets. CPB also includes license, royalty, other revenue and associated costs related to video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Our mobile strategy is to create a system-on-chip that enables the entertainment and web experiences that end users enjoy on a PC and other mobile devices. NVIDIA Tegra mobile products implement design techniques, both inside the chips and at the system level, which result in high performance and long battery life. These technologies enhance visual display capabilities, improve connectivity and minimize chip and system-level power consumption. We aim to innovate faster than the competition, introducing new features and capabilities to differentiate the user experience.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">In support of this strategy, during fiscal year 2012, we launched Tegra 3, the world&#39;s first quad-core mobile computing chip, bringing PC levels of performance within the power envelope of a cellular phone chip. Tegra 3 includes several unique innovations, including its variable symmetric multiprocessing architecture with companion core which enables extremely low-power operation during the majority of use cases, and PRISM, which increases battery life during video playback by 40%. Another notable innovation is DirectTouch, which significantly improves the responsiveness of touch-screen user interfaces on devices and simultaneously reduces costs for the device manufacturer. Our software expertise makes both of these inventions completely transparent to the operating system; that is, neither the operating system nor the application developer has to know about them for users to benefit from them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">During the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, we completed the acquisition of Icera, an innovator of baseband processors for 3G and 4G cellular phones and tablets. Icera&#39;s technology uses a custom-built, low-power processor and a software-based baseband which assist manufacturers to develop multiple products from a common platform, reduce development costs and accelerate time to market. Icera&#39;s high-speed wireless modem products have been approved by more than 50 carriers across the globe. In addition to leveraging on the existing Icera business, the objective of the acquisition is to accelerate and enhance the combination of our application processor with Icera&#39;s baseband processor for use in mobile devices such as smartphone and tablets. Please refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding this business combination.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our Strategy</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Maintain Technology and Product Leadership in Visual Computing. <span class="p">We believe that ongoing investment in research and development in 3D graphics and image processing is critical to the development and enhancement of innovative products and technologies. We are focused on using our advanced engineering capabilities to accelerate the quality and performance of 3D graphics, image processing and computational graphics to raise and change the user experience for both consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications. Our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of GPUs, including GPUs for high-performance computing, and mobile and consumer products using independent design teams. As we have in the past, we intend to use this strategy to achieve new levels of graphics, networking and communications features and performance and ultra-low power designs, enabling our customers to achieve superior performance in their products. One of our primary competitive advantages is the quality of our software, measured by performance, reliability, features and compatibility with other applications.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">6</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012/Image_003.png"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Advance Mobile Computing with Best-in-Class Ultra-Low Power System-On-Chip Processors. <span class="p">We believe that our expertise in graphics and low-power system architecture positions us to help drive continued market penetration through our applications processor roadmap. By deploying the new NVIDIA Icera baseband processor, we believe we can address a larger segment of the phone market. And further, by integrating the applications processor and baseband processor together in a single product, we believe we will be able to address an even larger segment next year.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Revolutionize High Performance Computing with Tesla and CUDA. <span class="p">Tesla is a family of GPU computing products that delivers processing capabilities for high- performance computing applications. NVIDIA CUDA is a general purpose parallel computing architecture that leverages the parallel compute engine in NVIDIA GPUs to solve many complex computational problems in a fraction of the time required by a CPU. We are working with developers around the world who have adopted and written application programs for the CUDA architecture using various high-level programming languages, which can then be run at significant execution speeds on our GPUs. Developers are able to accelerate algorithms in areas ranging from molecular dynamics to image processing, medical image reconstruction and derivatives modeling for financial risk analysis. We are also working with universities around the world that teach parallel programming with CUDA as well as with many PC , or OEMs that offer high performance computing solutions with Tesla for use by their customers around the world. We also sell directly to supercomputing centers such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the U.S. and the National Supercomputing Center in Tianjin, China. Researchers use CUDA to accelerate their time-to-discovery, and many popular off-the-shelf software packages are now CUDA-accelerated.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Use Our Intellectual Property and Resources to Enter into License and Development Contracts. <span class="p">We believe our technology leadership in graphics and mobile computing offers the opportunity to license our technology to customers that desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products. Accordingly, from time to time, we expect to enter into license and development arrangements, some of which may involve significant customization of our intellectual property components, to further enhance the reach of our graphics and mobile technology.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales and Marketing</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to our objective to become the leading supplier of , high-performance and efficient GPUs and mobile system-on- chip products. Our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industry&#39;s respective OEMs, original design manufacturers, or ODMs, system builders, motherboard manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs and industry trendsetters, collectively referred to as our Channel, to define product features, performance, price and timing of new products. Members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process. We also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist our Channel in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving our Channel&#39;s time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within our Channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">In the segments we serve that purchase our GPUs, the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading OEMs and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key ODMs, motherboard manufacturers and AIBs. These design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by AIB and motherboard manufacturers. Our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, ODMs, motherboard manufacturers, AIBs and distributors, each of which have relationships with a broad range of major OEMs and/or strong brand name recognition in the retail channel. Currently, we sell a significant portion of our processors directly to distributors, CEMs, ODMs, motherboard manufacturers and add-in board manufacturers, which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading OEMs, retail outlets and a large number of system builders. In the CPB segment that we serve, the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading mobile OEMs and supporting the product design into high-volume production.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">As a result of our Channel strategy, a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue. However, their end customers consist of a large number of OEMs and system builders throughout the world. Sales to our largest customer accounted for 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2012.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">To encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products, as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">7</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012/Image_004.png"/></span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backlog</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers&#39; requirements and in manufacturing availability. The semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. In light of industry practice and experience, we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seasonality</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market. Historically, we have seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year than in the first half of our fiscal year, primarily due to back-to-school and holiday demand. However, there can be no assurance of this trend.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products. Instead, we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our product-line operating segments whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability and testing. In addition, this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. Our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing and customer support.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., Amkor Technology, JSI Logistics Ltd., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. and STATS ChipPAC Incorporated to perform assembly, testing and packaging of most of our products. We purchase substrates from Nanya Technology Corporation, IbidenCo., Ltd. and Unimicron Technology Corporation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to CEMs, distributors, motherboard and AIB customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship the products to retailers, system builders or OEMs as motherboard and add-in board solutions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Inventory and Working Capital</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our management focuses considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a product-by-product basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand. The quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers&#39; requirements and in manufacturing availability. We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 25.7% at the end of fiscal year 2012 compared with the end of fiscal year 2011. We believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading 3D graphics, HD video, audio, ultra-low power consumption and system-on-chip architectures is essential to our future success. Our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of GPUs, including GPUs for high-performance computing, and mobile and consumer products using independent design teams. Our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering, hardware engineering, very large scale integration design engineering, process engineering, architecture and algorithms. These groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">8</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012/Image_005.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">A critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer-aided design industry. We invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders, often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products. We believe that forming these relationships and utilizing next-generation development tools to design, simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3D graphics market and develop products that utilize leading-edge technology on a rapid basis. We believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of PC OEMs and other manufacturers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">As of January 29, 2012, we had 5,042 full-time employees engaged in research and development. During fiscal years2012, 2011 and 2010, we incurred research and development expense of $1,002.6 million, $848.8 million and $908.9 million, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard Application Programming Interfaces, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs and mobile and consumer products. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our current competitors include:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l1"><li style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">suppliers of GPUs, including chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, Intel, Matrox Electronics Systems Ltd. and VIA Technologies, Inc.;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">suppliers of system-on-chip products that support tablets, smartphones, portable media players, internet television, automotive navigation and other similar devices, such as AMD, ARM Holdings plc, Broadcom Corporation, Freescale Semiconductor Inc., Fujitsu Limited, Imagination Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., NEC Corporation, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Technology Corp., Samsung Electronics Co.

We expect substantial competition from both Intel&#39;s and AMD&#39;s strategy of selling platform solutions, including integrating a CPU and a GPU on the same chip or same package, as evidenced by AMD&#39;s announcement of its Fusion processors and Intel&#39;s announcement of its family of CPUs codenamed Sandy Bridge. As AMD and Intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated CPUs, we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="704" height="2" alt="image" src="頁面擷取自-2012/Image_006.png"/></span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Patents and Proprietary Rights</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from March 2012 to January 2031. We have numerous patents issued, allowed and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l2"><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the location in which our products are manufactured;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors&#39; operations in particular countries and regions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved. In addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business. We have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons, and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements. These licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties, the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could suffer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">As of January 29, 2012, we had 7,133 employees, 5,042 of whom were engaged in research and development and2,091 of whom were engaged in sales, marketing, operations and administrative positions.
